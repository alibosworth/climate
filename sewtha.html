to those who will not have the benefit of two billion years&#x27; accumulated energy reserves</p><h1 id="preface">Preface</h1><h2 id="whats-this-book-about">What‚Äôs this book about?</h2><p>I‚Äôm concerned about cutting UK emissions of twaddle ‚Äì twaddle about sustainable energy. Everyone says getting off fossil fuels is important, and we‚Äôre all encouraged to &quot;make a difference,&quot; but many of the things that allegedly make a difference don‚Äôt add up.</p><p>Twaddle emissions are high at the moment because people get emotional (for example about wind farms or nuclear power) and no-one talks about numbers. Or if they do mention numbers, they select them to sound big, to make an impression, and to score points in arguments, rather than to aid thoughtful discussion.</p><p>This is a straight-talking book about the numbers. The aim is to guide the reader around the claptrap to actions that really make a difference and to policies that add up.</p><h2 id="this-is-a-free-book">This is a free book</h2><p>I didn‚Äôt write this book to make money. I wrote it because sustainable energy is important. If you would like to have the book for free for your own use, please help yourself: it‚Äôs on the internet at <a class="jsx-1614200154 " href="http://www.withouthotair.com"><span class="websitetitle">www.withouthotair.com</span></a>.</p><p>This is a free book in a second sense: you are free to use <em>all</em> the material in this book, <em>except</em> for the cartoons and the photos with a named photographer, under the Creative Commons Attribution-Non-Commercial-ShareAlike 2.0 UK: England &amp; Wales Licence.

Please don‚Äôt assume that my quoting someone means that I agree with them; think of these quotes as provocations, as hypotheses to be critically assessed.</p><p>Many of the early chapters (numbered 1, 2, 3, ...) have longer technical chapters (A, B, C, ...) associated with them. These technical chapters comprise Part III.</p><p>At the end of each chapter are further notes and pointers to sources and references. I find footnote marks distracting if they litter the main text of a book, so the printed book had no footnote marks. Discrete end-note marks have been added to this ebook to allow easy referencing.</p><p>The text also contains pointers to web resources. When a web-pointer is monstrously long, I‚Äôve used the TinyURL ervice, and put the tiny code in the text like this ‚Äì <!-- -->[<span class="websitetitle">yh8xse</span>]<!-- --> ‚Äì which is shorthand for a tiny URL, in this case: <span class="websitetitle"><a class="jsx-1614200154 " href="http://tinyurl.com/yh8xse">http://tinyurl.com/yh8xse</a></span>.

I am aware that I sometimes make booboos, and in earlier drafts of this book some of my numbers were off by a factor of two. While I hope that the errors that remain are smaller than that, I expect to further update some of the numbers in this book as I continue to learn about sustainable energy.</p><p>How to cite this book:</p><p><strong>David J.C.

of Gaia: Why the earth is Ô¨Åghting back ‚Äì and how we can still save humanity.</em> James Lovelock (2006). ¬© Allen Lane.</p><p>I recently read two books, one by a physicist, and one by an economist. In <em>Out of Gas</em>, Caltech physicist David Goodstein describes an impending energy crisis brought on by The End of the Age of Oil. This crisis is coming soon, he predicts: the crisis will bite, not when the last drop of oil is extracted, but when oil extraction can‚Äôt meet demand ‚Äì perhaps as soon as 2015 or 2025. Moreover, even if we magically switched all our energy guzzling to nuclear power right away, Goodstein says, the oil crisis would simply be replaced by a <em>nuclear</em> crisis in just twenty years or so, as uranium reserves also became depleted.</p><p>In <em>The Skeptical Environmentalist</em>, Bj√∏rn Lomborg paints a completely different picture. &quot;Everything is Ô¨Åne.&quot; Indeed, &quot;everything is getting better.&quot; Furthermore, &quot;we are not headed for a major energy crisis,&quot; and &quot;there is plenty of energy.&quot;</p><p>How could two smart people come to such different conclusions? I had to get to the bottom of this.</p><p>Energy made it into the British news in 2006. Kindled by tidings of great climate change and a tripling in the price of natural gas in just six years, the Ô¨Çames of debate are raging. How should Britain handle its energy needs? And how should the world?</p><p>&quot;Wind or nuclear?&quot;, for example. Greater polarization of views among smart people is hard to imagine. During a discussion of the proposed expansion of nuclear power, Michael Meacher, former environment minister, said &quot;if we‚Äôre going to cut greenhouse gases by 60% ... by 2050 there is no other possible way of doing that except through renewables;&quot; Sir Bernard Ingham, former civil servant, speaking in favour of nuclear expansion, said &quot;anybody who is relying upon renewables to Ô¨Åll the <!-- -->[<!-- -->energy<!-- -->]<!-- --> gap is living in an utter dream world and is, in my view, an enemy of the people.&quot;<sup id="fnref-ch01n01"><a class="jsx-1614200154 footnote-ref" href="/sewtha#fn-ch01n01">ch01n01</a></sup><span class="red"> <!-- -->*</span></p><span class="red">\*</span> Every chapter has endnotes giving references, sources, and details of arguments. Their presence will be indicated in this way. The <span class="darkred">\[1\]</span> here links to the relevant end-note. The <span class="darkred">\[1\]</span> in the end-notes will return here.<p>Similar disagreement can be heard within the ecological movement. All agree that <em>something</em> must be done urgently, but <em>what?</em> Jonathon Porritt<sup id="fnref-ch01n02"><a class="jsx-1614200154 footnote-ref" href="/sewtha#fn-ch01n02">ch01n02</a></sup>, chair of the Sustainable Development Commission, writes: &quot;there is no justiÔ¨Åcation for bringing forward plans for a new nuclear power programme at this time, and ... any such proposal would be incompatible with <!-- -->[<!-- -->the Government‚Äôs<!-- -->]<!-- --> sustainable development strategy;&quot; and &quot;a nonnuclear strategy could and should be sufÔ¨Åcient to deliver all the carbon savings we shall need up to 2050 and beyond, and to ensure secure access to reliable sources of energy.&quot; In contrast, environmentalist James Lovelock writes in his book, <em>The Revenge of Gaia</em>: &quot;Now is much too late to establish sustainable development.&quot; In his view, power from nuclear Ô¨Åssion, while¬†not recommended as the long-term panacea for our ailing planet, is &quot;the only effective medicine we have now.&quot; Onshore wind turbines are &quot;merely ... a gesture to prove <!-- -->[<!-- -->our leaders‚Äô<!-- -->]<!-- --> environmental credentials.&quot;</p><p>This heated debate is fundamentally about numbers. How much energy could each source deliver, at what economic and social cost, and with what risks? But actual numbers are rarely mentioned. In public debates, people just say &quot;Nuclear is a money pit&quot; or &quot;We have a <em>huge</em> amount of wave and wind.&quot;<sup id="fnref-ch01n03"><a class="jsx-1614200154 footnote-ref" href="/sewtha#fn-ch01n03">ch01n03</a></sup> The trouble with this sort of language is that it‚Äôs not sufÔ¨Åcient to know that something is huge: we need to know how the one &quot;huge&quot; compares with another &quot;huge,&quot; namely <em>our huge energy consumption</em>. To make this comparison, we need numbers, not adjectives.</p><p>Where numbers are used, their meaning is often obfuscated by enormousness. Numbers are chosen to impress, to score points in arguments, rather than to inform. &quot;Los Angeles residents drive 142 million miles ‚Äì the distance from Earth to Mars ‚Äì every single day.<sup id="fnref-ch01n04"><a class="jsx-1614200154 footnote-ref" href="/sewtha#fn-ch01n04">ch01n04</a></sup>&quot; &quot;Each year, 27 million acres of tropical rainforest are destroyed.&quot; &quot;14 billion pounds of trash are dumped into the sea every year.&quot; &quot;British people throw away 2.6 billion slices of bread per year.&quot; &quot;The waste paper buried each year in the UK could Ô¨Åll 103448 double-decker buses.&quot;</p><p>If all the ineffective ideas for solving the energy crisis were laid end to end, they would reach to the moon and back.... I digress.</p><p>The result of this lack of meaningful numbers and facts? We are inundated with a Ô¨Çood of crazy innumerate codswallop. The BBC doles out advice on how we can do our bit to save the planet ‚Äì for example &quot;switch off your mobile phone charger when it‚Äôs not in use;&quot; if anyone objects that mobile phone chargers are not <em>actually</em> our number one form of energy consumption, the mantra &quot;every little helps&quot; is wheeled out. Every little helps? A more realistic mantra is:</p><p><em>if everyone does a little, we‚Äôll achieve only a little.</em></p><p>For the beneÔ¨Åt of readers who speak American, rather than English, the translation of &quot;every little helps&quot; into American is &quot;every little bit helps.&quot;</p><p>Companies also contribute to the daily codswallop as they tell us how wonderful they are, or how they can help us &quot;do our bit.&quot; BP‚Äôs website, for example, celebrates the reductions in carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) pollution they hope to achieve by changing the paint used for painting BP‚Äôs ships. Does anyone fall for this? Surely everyone will guess that it‚Äôs not the exterior paint job, it‚Äôs the stuff <em>inside</em> the tanker that deserves attention, if society‚Äôs CO<sub>2</sub> emissions are to be signiÔ¨Åcantly cut? BP also created a web-based carbon absolution service, &quot;<span class="websitetitle">targetneutral.com</span>,&quot;<sup id="fnref-ch01n05"><a class="jsx-1614200154 footnote-ref" href="/sewtha#fn-ch01n05">ch01n05</a></sup> which claims that they can &quot;neutralize&quot; all your carbon emissions, and that it &quot;doesn‚Äôt cost the earth&quot; ‚Äì indeed, that your CO<sub>2</sub> pollution can be cleaned up for just ¬£40 per year. How can this add up? ‚Äì if the true cost of Ô¨Åxing climate change were ¬£40 per person then the government could Ô¨Åx it with the loose change in the Chancellor‚Äôs pocket<!-- -->!</p><p>Even more reprehensible are companies that exploit the current concern for the environment by offering &quot;water-powered batteries,&quot; &quot;biodegradable mobile phones,&quot; &quot;portable arm-mounted wind-turbines,&quot; and other pointless tat.</p><p>Campaigners also mislead.

The capacity is the maximum deliverable power of a source.<h2 id="why-are-we-discussing-energy-policy">Why are we discussing energy policy?</h2><p>Three different motivations drive today‚Äôs energy discussions.</p><p>First, fossil fuels are a Ô¨Ånite resource. It seems possible that cheap oil (on which our cars and lorries run) and cheap gas (with which we heat many of our buildings) will run out in our lifetime. So we seek alternative energy sources. Indeed given that fossil fuels are a valuable resource, useful for manufacture of plastics and all sorts of other creative stuff, perhaps we should save them for better uses than simply setting Ô¨Åre to them.</p><p>Second, we‚Äôre interested in security of energy supply. Even if fossil fuels are still available somewhere in the world, perhaps we don‚Äôt want to depend on them if that would make our economy vulnerable to the whims of untrustworthy foreigners. (I hope you can hear my tongue in my cheek.) Going by Ô¨Ågure 1.2, it certainly looks as if &quot;our&quot; fossil fuels have peaked. The UK has a particular security-of-supply problem looming, known as the &quot;energy gap.&quot; A substantial number of old coal power stations and nuclear power stations will be closing down during the next decade (Ô¨Ågure 1.3), so there is a risk that electricity demand will sometimes exceed electricity supply, if adequate plans are not implemented.</p><p>Third, it‚Äôs very probable that using fossil fuels changes the climate. Climate change is blamed on several human activities, but the biggest contributor to climate change is the increase in greenhouse effect produced by carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>). Most of the carbon dioxide emissions come from fossil-fuel burning. And the main reason we burn fossil fuels is for energy. So to Ô¨Åx climate change, we need to sort out a new way of getting energy. The climate problem is mostly an energy problem.</p><p>Whichever of these three concerns motivates you, we need energy numbers, and policies that add up.</p><p>The Ô¨Årst two concerns are straightforward selÔ¨Åsh motivations for drastically reducing fossil fuel use. The third concern, climate change, is a more altruistic motivation ‚Äì the brunt of climate change will be borne not by us but by future generations over many hundreds of years. Some people feel that climate change is not their responsibility. They say things like &quot;What‚Äôs the point in my doing anything? China‚Äôs out of control<!-- -->!<!-- -->&quot; So I‚Äôm going to discuss climate change a bit more now, because while writing this book I learned some interesting facts that shed light on these ethical questions. If you have no interest in climate change, feel free to fast-forward to the next section.</p><h2 id="the-climate-change-motivation">The climate-change motivation</h2><p>The climate-change motivation is argued in three steps: one: human fossilfuel burning causes carbon dioxide concentrations to rise; two: carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas; three: increasing the greenhouse effect increases average global temperatures (and has many other effects).</p><p><img src="/img/sewtha/figure6.gif"/></p><span class="figurenumber">Figure 1.4.</span> Carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) concentrations (in parts per million) for the last 1100 years, measured from air trapped in ice cores (up to 1977) and directly in Hawaii (from 1958 onwards).<p>I think something new may have happened between 1800 AD and 2000 AD.

Production rates are shown in billions of tons of CO<sub>2</sub> ‚Äì an incomprehensible unit, yes, but don‚Äôt worry: we‚Äôll personalize it shortly.<p>We start with the fact that carbon dioxide concentrations are rising. Figure 1.4 shows measurements of the CO<sub>2</sub> concentration in the air from the year 1000AD to the present. Some &quot;sceptics&quot; have asserted that the recent increase in CO<sub>2</sub> concentration is a natural phenomenon. Does &quot;sceptic&quot; mean &quot;a person who has not even glanced at the data&quot;? Don‚Äôt you think, just possibly, <em>something</em> may have happened between 1800AD and 2000AD? Something that was not part of the natural processes present in the preceding thousand years?</p><p>Something did happen, and it was called the Industrial Revolution. I‚Äôve marked on the graph the year 1769, in which James Watt patented his steam engine. While the Ô¨Årst practical steam engine was invented in 1698, Watt‚Äôs more efÔ¨Åcient steam engine really got the Industrial Revolution going. One of the steam engine‚Äôs main applications was the pumping of water out of coal mines. Figure 1.5 shows what happened to British coal production from 1769 onwards. The Ô¨Ågure displays coal production in units of billions of tons of CO<sub>2</sub> released when the coal was burned. In 1800, coal was used to make iron, to make ships, to heat buildings, to power locomotives and other machinery, and of course to power the pumps that enabled still more coal to be scraped up from inside the hills of England and Wales. Britain was terribly well endowed with coal: when the Revolution started, the amount of carbon sitting in coal under Britain was roughly the same as the amount sitting in oil under Saudi Arabia.</p><p>In the 30 years from 1769 to 1800, Britain‚Äôs annual coal production doubled. After another 30 years (1830), it had doubled again. The next doubling of production-rate happened within <em>20</em> years (1850), and another doubling within 20 years of that (1870). This coal allowed Britain to turn the globe pink. The prosperity that came to England and Wales was reÔ¨Çected in a century of unprecedented population growth:</p><p><img src="/img/sewtha/figure14.gif" alt="population England"/></p><p>Eventually other countries got in on the act too as the Revolution spread. Figure 1.6 shows British coal production and world coal production on the same scale as Ô¨Ågure 1.5, sliding the window of history 50 years later. British coal production peaked in 1910, but meanwhile world coal production continued to double every 20 years. It‚Äôs difÔ¨Åcult to show the history of coal production on a single graph. To show what happened in the <em>next</em> 50 years on the same scale, the book would need to be one metre tall<!-- -->!<!-- --> To cope with this difÔ¨Åculty, we can either scale down the vertical axis:</p><p><img src="/img/sewtha/figure15.gif" alt="population world"/></p><p><img src="/img/sewtha/figure16.gif" alt="UK and world coal production"/></p><span class="figurenumber">Figure 1.6.</span> What happened next.

A good way to squish the axis is called a logarithmic scale, and that‚Äôs what I‚Äôve used in the bottom two graphs of Ô¨Ågure 1.7. On a logarithmic scale, all ten-fold increases (from 1 to 10, from 10 to 100, from 100 to 1000) are represented by equal distances on the page. On a logarithmic scale, a quantity that grows at a constant percentage per year (which is called &quot;exponential growth&quot;) looks like a straight line. Logarithmic graphs are great¬†for understanding growth. Whereas the ordinary graphs in the Ô¨Ågures on pages 6 and 7 convey the messages that British and world coal production grew remarkably, and that British and world population grew remarkably, the relative growth rates are not evident in these ordinary graphs. The logarithmic graphs allow us to compare growth rates. Looking at the slopes of the population curves, for example, we can see that the world population‚Äôs growth rate in the last 50 years was a little bigger than the growth rate of England and Wales in 1800.</p><p>From 1769 to 2006, world annual coal production increased 800-fold. Coal production is still increasing today. Other fossil fuels are being extracted too ‚Äì the middle graph of Ô¨Ågure 1.7 shows oil production for example ‚Äì but in terms of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions, coal is still king.</p><p>The burning of fossil fuels is the principal reason why CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations have gone up. This is a fact, but, hang on: I hear a persistent buzzing noise coming from a bunch of climate-change inactivists. What are they saying? Here‚Äôs Dominic Lawson, a columnist from the <em>Independent</em>:</p><p>&quot;The burning of fossil fuels sends about <span class="red">seven gigatons</span> of CO<sub>2</sub> per year into the atmosphere, which sounds like a lot. Yet the biosphere and the oceans send about <span class="green">1900 gigatons</span> and <span class="darkblue">36000</span> <span class="darkblue">gigatons</span> of CO<sub>2</sub> per year into the atmosphere ‚Äì ... one reason why some of us are sceptical about the emphasis put on the role of human fuel-burning in the greenhouse gas effect. Reducing man-made CO<sub>2</sub> emissions is megalomania, exaggerating man‚Äôs signiÔ¨Åcance. Politicians can‚Äôt change the weather.&quot;<sup id="fnref-ch01n13"><a class="jsx-1614200154 footnote-ref" href="/sewtha#fn-ch01n13">ch01n13</a></sup></p><p>Now I have a lot of time for scepticism, and not everything that sceptics say is a crock of manure ‚Äì but irresponsible journalism like Dominic Lawson‚Äôs deserves a good Ô¨Çushing.</p><p>The Ô¨Årst problem with Lawson‚Äôs offering is that <em>all three numbers</em> that he mentions (<span class="red">seven</span>, <span class="green">1900</span>, and <span class="darkblue">36000</span>) are <em>wrong<!-- -->!</em> The correct numbers are <span class="red">26</span>, <span class="green">440</span>, and <span class="darkblue">330</span>. Leaving these errors to one side, let‚Äôs address Lawson‚Äôs main point, the relative smallness of man-made emissions.</p><p>Yes, natural Ô¨Çows of CO<sub>2</sub> <em>are</em> larger than the additional Ô¨Çow we switched on 200 years ago when we started burning fossil fuels in earnest. But it is terribly misleading to quantify only the large natural Ô¨Çows <em>into</em> the atmosphere, failing to mention the almost exactly equal Ô¨Çows <em>out</em> of the atmosphere back into the biosphere and the oceans. The point is that these <em>natural</em> Ô¨Çows in and out of the atmosphere have been almost exactly in balance for millenia. So it‚Äôs not relevant at all that these natural Ô¨Çows are larger than human emissions. The natural Ô¨Çows <em>cancelled themselves out</em>. So the natural Ô¨Çows, large though they were, left the concentration of CO<sub>2</sub> in the atmosphere and ocean <em>constant</em>, over the last few thousand years. Burning fossil fuels, in contrast, creates a <em>new</em> Ô¨Çow of carbon that, though small, is <em>not cancelled</em>. Here‚Äôs a simple analogy, set in the passport-control arrivals area of an airport.</p><p>One thousand passengers arrive per hour, and there are exactly enough clockwork ofÔ¨Åcials to process <span class="darkblue">one thousand pas</span><span class="darkblue">sengers per hour</span>. There‚Äôs a modest queue, but because of the match of arrival rate to service rate, the queue isn‚Äôt getting any longer. Now imagine that owing to fog an extra stream of Ô¨Çights is diverted here from a smaller airport. This stream adds an extra <span class="red">50 passengers per hour</span> to the arrivals lobby ‚Äì a small addition compared to the original arrival rate of one thousand per hour. Initially at least, the authorities don‚Äôt increase the number of ofÔ¨Åcials, and the ofÔ¨Åcials carry on processing just one thousand passengers per hour. So what happens? Slowly but surely, <em>the queue grows</em>. Burning fossil fuels is undeniably increasing the CO<sub>2</sub> concentration in the atmosphere and in the surface oceans. No climate scientist disputes this fact. When it comes to CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations, man <em>is</em> signiÔ¨Åcant.</p><p><img src="/img/sewtha/figure7.gif" alt="CO2 concentrations, consequences of Industrial Revolution"/></p><span class="figurenumber">Figure 1.7.</span> The upper graph shows carbon dioxide CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations (in parts per million) for the last 1100 years ‚Äì the same data that was shown in Ô¨Ågure 1.4.<p><img src="/img/sewtha/jw.gif" alt="James Watt"/></p><p>Here‚Äôs a portrait of James Watt and his 1769 steam engine.</p><p>The middle graph shows (on a logarithmic scale) the history of UK coal production, Saudi oil production, world coal production, world oil production, and (by the top right point) the total of all greenhouse gas emissions in the year 2000. All production rates are expressed in units of the associated CO<sub>2</sub> emissions.</p><p>The bottom graph shows (on a logarithmic scale) some consequences of the Industrial Revolution: sharp increases in the population of England, and, in due course, the world; and remarkable growth in British pig-iron production (in thousand tons per year); and growth in the tonnage of British ships (in thousand tons).</p><p>In contrast to the ordinary graphs on the previous pages, the logarithmic scale allows us to show both the population of England and the population of the World on a single diagram, and to see interesting features in both.</p><p>OK. Fossil fuel burning increases CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations signiÔ¨Åcantly. But does it matter? &quot;Carbon is nature<!-- -->!<!-- -->&quot;, the oilspinners remind us, &quot;Carbon is life<!-- -->!<!-- -->&quot; If CO<sub>2</sub> had no harmful effects, then indeed carbon emissions would not matter. However, carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas. Not the strongest greenhouse gas, but a signiÔ¨Åcant one nonetheless. Put more of it in the atmosphere, and it does what greenhouse gases do: it absorbs infrared radiation (heat) heading out from the earth and reemits it in a random direction; the effect of this random redirection of the atmospheric heat trafÔ¨Åc is to impede the Ô¨Çow of heat from the planet, just like a quilt. So carbon dioxide has a warming effect.<sup id="fnref-ch01n14"><a class="jsx-1614200154 footnote-ref" href="/sewtha#fn-ch01n14">ch01n14</a></sup> This fact is based not on complex historical records of global temperatures but on the simple physical properties of CO<sub>2</sub> molecules. Greenhouse gases are a quilt, and CO<sub>2</sub> is one layer of the quilt.</p><p>So, if humanity succeeds in doubling or tripling CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations (which is where we are certainly heading, under business as usual), what happens? Here, there is a lot of uncertainty. Climate science is difÔ¨Åcult. The climate is a complex, twitchy beast, and exactly how much warming CO<sub>2</sub> -doubling would produce is uncertain. The consensus of the best climate models seems to be that doubling the CO<sub>2</sub> concentration would have roughly the same effect as increasing the intensity of the sun by 2%, and would bump up the global mean temperature by something like 3¬∞C. This would be what historians call a Bad Thing. I won‚Äôt recite the whole litany of probable drastic effects, as I am sure you‚Äôve heard it before.<sup id="fnref-ch01n15"><a class="jsx-1614200154 footnote-ref" href="/sewtha#fn-ch01n15">ch01n15</a></sup> The litany begins &quot;the Greenland icecap would gradually melt, and, over a period of a few 100 years, sea-level would rise by about 7¬†metres.&quot; The brunt of the litany falls on future generations. Such temperatures have not been seen on earth for at least 100¬†000 years, and it‚Äôs conceivable that the ecosystem would be so signiÔ¨Åcantly altered that the earth would stop supplying some of the goods and services that we currently take for granted.</p><span id="chap01.xhtml#page11">Climate</span> modelling is difÔ¨Åcult and is dogged by uncertainties. But uncertainty about exactly how the climate will respond to extra greenhouse gases is no justiÔ¨Åcation for inaction. If you were riding a fast-moving motorcycle in fog near a cliff-edge, and you didn‚Äôt have a good map of the cliff, would the lack of a map justify *not* slowing the bike down?<p>So, who should slow the bike down? Who should clean up carbon emissions? Who is responsible for climate change? This is an ethical question, of course, not a scientiÔ¨Åc one, but ethical discussions must be founded on facts. Let‚Äôs now explore the facts about greenhouse gas emissions. First, a word about the units in which they are measured. Greenhouse gases include carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide; each gas has different physical properties; it‚Äôs conventional to express all gas emissions in &quot;equivalent amounts of carbon dioxide,&quot; where &quot;equivalent&quot; means &quot;having the same warming effect over a period of 100 years.&quot; One ton of carbon-dioxide-equivalent may be abbreviated as &quot;1 t CO<sub>2</sub>e,&quot; and one billion tons (one thousand million tons) as &quot;1 Gt CO<sub>2</sub>e&quot; (one gigaton). In this book 1 t means one metric ton (1000 kg). I‚Äôm not going to distinguish imperial tons, because they differ by less than 10% from the metric ton or tonne.</p><p>In the year 2000, the world‚Äôs greenhouse gas emissions were about 34 billion tons of CO<sub>2</sub>-equivalent per year. An incomprehensible number. But we can render it more comprehensible and more personal by dividing by the number of people on the planet, 6 billion, so as to obtain the greenhouse-gas pollution <em>per person</em>, which is about 5¬Ω tons CO<sub>2</sub>e per year per person. We can thus represent the world emissions by a rectangle whose width is the population (6 billion) and whose height is the percapita emissions.</p><p><img src="/img/sewtha/figure9.gif" alt="Greenhouse gas pollution"/></p><p>Now, all people are created equal, but we don‚Äôt all emit 5¬Ω tons of CO<sub>2</sub> per year. We can break down the emissions of the year 2000, showing how the 34-billion-ton rectangle is shared between the regions of the world:<sup id="fnref-ch01n16"><a class="jsx-1614200154 footnote-ref" href="/sewtha#fn-ch01n16">ch01n16</a></sup></p><p><img src="/img/sewtha/figure10.gif" alt="Greenhouse gas pollution"/></p><p>This picture, which is on the same scale as the previous one, divides the world into eight regions. Each rectangle‚Äôs area represents the greenhouse gas emissions of one region. The width of the rectangle is the population of the region, and the height is the average per-capita emissions in that region.</p><p>In the year 2000, Europe‚Äôs per-capita greenhouse gas emissions were twice the world average; and North America‚Äôs were four times the world average.</p><p>We can continue subdividing, splitting each of the regions into countries. This is where it gets really interesting:</p><p><img src="/img/sewtha/figure11.gif" alt="Greenhouse gas pollution"/></p><p>The major countries with the biggest per-capita emissions are Australia, the USA, and Canada. European countries, Japan, and South Africa are notable runners up. Among European countries, the United Kingdom is resolutely average. What about China, that naughty &quot;out of control&quot; country? Yes, the area of China‚Äôs rectangle is about the same as the USA‚Äôs, but the fact is that their per-capita emissions are <em>below</em> the world average. India‚Äôs per-capita emissions are less than <em>half</em> the world average. Moreover, it‚Äôs worth bearing in mind that much of the industrial emissions of China and India are associated with the manufacture of <em>stuff for rich countries.</em></p><p>So, assuming that &quot;something needs to be done&quot; to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, who has a special responsibility to do something? As I said, that‚Äôs an ethical question. But I Ô¨Ånd it hard to imagine any system of ethics that denies that the responsibility falls especially on the countries¬†to the left hand side of this diagram ‚Äì the countries whose emissions are two, three, or four times the world average. Countries that are most able to pay. Countries like Britain and the USA, for example.</p><h3 id="historical-responsibility-for-climate-impact">Historical responsibility for climate impact</h3><p>If we assume that the climate has been damaged by human activity, and that someone needs to Ô¨Åx it, who should pay? Some people say &quot;the polluter should pay.&quot; The preceding pictures showed who‚Äôs doing the polluting today. But it isn‚Äôt the <em>rate</em> of CO<sub>2</sub> pollution that matters, it‚Äôs the cumulative <em>total</em> emissions; much of the emitted carbon dioxide (about one third of it) will hang around in the atmosphere for at least 50 or 100 years. If we accept the ethical idea that &quot;the polluter should pay&quot; then we should ask how big is each country‚Äôs historical footprint. The next picture shows each country‚Äôs cumulative emissions of CO<sub>2</sub>, expressed as an average emission rate over the period 1880‚Äì2004.</p><p><img src="/img/sewtha/figure12.gif" alt="Average pollution rate"/></p><p>Congratulations, Britain<!-- -->!<!-- --> The UK has made it onto the winners‚Äô podium.

Both scenarios are believed to offer a modest chance of avoiding a 2¬∞C temperature rise above the pre-industrial level.[^ch01n19]<p>OK, that‚Äôs enough ethics. What do scientists reckon needs to be done, to avoid a risk of giving the earth a 2¬∞C temperature rise (2¬∞C being the rise above which they predict lots of bad consequences)? The consensus is clear. We need to get off our fossil fuel habit, and we need to do so fast. Some countries, including Britain, have committed to at least a 60% reduction in greenhouse-gas emissions by 2050,<sup id="fnref-ch01n18"><a class="jsx-1614200154 footnote-ref" href="/sewtha#fn-ch01n18">ch01n18</a></sup> but it must be emphasized that 60% cuts, radical though they are, are unlikely to cut the mustard. If the world‚Äôs emissions were gradually reduced by 60% by 2050, climate scientists reckon it‚Äôs more likely than not that global temperatures will rise by more than 2¬∞C. The sort of cuts we need to aim for are shown in Ô¨Ågure 1.8. This Ô¨Ågure shows two possibly-safe emissions scenarios presented by Baer and Mastrandrea (2006) in a report from the Institute for Public Policy Research. The lower curve assumes that a decline in emissions started in 2007, with total global emissions falling at roughly 5% per year. The upper curve assumes a brief delay in the start of the decline, and a 4% drop per year in global emissions. Both scenarios are believed to offer a modest chance of avoiding a 2¬∞C temperature rise above the pre-industrial level. In the lower scenario, the chance that the temperature rise will <em>exceed</em> 2¬∞C is estimated to be 9‚Äì26%. In the upper scenario, the chance of exceeding 2¬∞C is estimated to be 16‚Äì43%. These possibly-safe emissions trajectories, by the way, involve signiÔ¨Åcantly sharper reductions in emissions than any of the scenarios presented by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), or by the Stern Review (2007).</p><p>These possibly-safe trajectories require global emissions to fall by 70% or 85% by 2050. What would this mean for a country like Britain? If we subscribe to the idea of &quot;contraction and convergence,&quot; which means that all countries aim eventually to have equal per-capita emissions, then Britain needs to aim for cuts greater than 85%: it should get down from its current 11 tons of CO<sub>2</sub>e per year per person to roughly <span class="red">1 ton per year per</span> <span class="red">person</span> by 2050. This is such a deep cut, I suggest the best way to think about it is <em>no more fossil fuels.</em></p><p><img src="/img/sewtha/figure8.gif" alt="World greenhouse gas emissions"/></p><span class="figurenumber">Figure 1.9.</span> Breakdown of world greenhouse-gas emissions (2000) by cause and by gas. &quot;Energy&quot; includes power stations, industrial processes, transport, fossil fuel processing, and energy-use in buildings. &quot;Land use, biomass burning&quot; means changes in land use, deforestation, and the burning of un-renewed biomass such as peat. &quot;Waste&quot; includes waste disposal and treatment.

Source: Emission Database for Global Atmospheric Research.<p>One last thing about the climate-change motivation: while a range of human activities cause greenhouse-gas emissions, the biggest cause by far is <strong>energy use</strong>. Some people justify not doing anything about their energy use by excuses such as &quot;methane from burping cows causes more warming than jet travel.&quot; Yes, agricultural by-products contributed one eighth of greenhouse-gas emissions in the year 2000.

I‚Äôm going to assume we are motivated to get off fossil fuels. Whatever your motivation, the aim of this book is to help you Ô¨Ågure out the numbers and do the arithmetic so that you can evaluate policies; and to lay a factual foundation so that you can see <em>which proposals add up</em>. I‚Äôm not claiming that the arithmetic and numbers in this book are new; the books I‚Äôve mentioned by Goodstein, Lomborg, and Lovelock, for example, are full of interesting numbers and back-of-envelope calculations, and there are many other helpful sources on the internet too.<sup id="fnref-ch01n20"><a class="jsx-1614200154 footnote-ref" href="/sewtha#fn-ch01n20">ch01n20</a></sup></p><p>What I‚Äôm aiming to do in this book is to make these numbers simple and memorable; to show you how you can Ô¨Ågure out the numbers for yourself; and to make the situation so clear that any thinking reader will be able to draw striking conclusions. I don‚Äôt want to feed you my own conclusions. Convictions are stronger if they are self-generated, rather than taught. Understanding is a creative process. When you‚Äôve read this book I hope you‚Äôll have reinforced the conÔ¨Ådence that you can Ô¨Ågure anything out.</p><p>I‚Äôd like to emphasize that the calculations we will do are deliberately imprecise. SimpliÔ¨Åcation is a key to understanding. First, by rounding the numbers, we can make them easier to remember. Second, rounded numbers allow quick calculations. For example, in this book, the population of the United Kingdom is 60¬†million, and the population of the world is 6 billion. I‚Äôm perfectly capable of looking up more accurate Ô¨Ågures, but accuracy would get in the way of Ô¨Çuent thought. For example, if we learn that the world‚Äôs greenhouse gas emissions in 2000 were 34 billion tons of CO<sub>2</sub>-equivalent per year, then we can instantly note, without a calculator, that the average emissions per person are 5 or 6 tons of CO<sub>2</sub>-equivalent per person per year. This rough answer is not exact, but it‚Äôs accurate enough to inform interesting conversations. For instance, if you learn that a roundtrip intercontinental Ô¨Çight emits nearly two tons of CO<sub>2</sub> per passenger, then knowing the average emissions yardstick (5-and-a-bit tons per year per person) helps you realize that just one such plane-trip per year corresponds to over a third of the average person‚Äôs carbon emissions.</p><p>I like to base my calculations on everyday knowledge rather than on trawling through impersonal national statistics. For example, if I want to estimate the typical wind speeds in Cambridge, I ask &quot;is my cycling speed usually faster than the wind?&quot; The answer is yes. So I can deduce that the wind speed in Cambridge is only rarely faster than my typical cycling speed of 20km/h. I back up these everyday estimates with other peoples‚Äô calculations and with ofÔ¨Åcial statistics. (Please look for these in each chapter‚Äôs end-notes.) This book isn‚Äôt intended to be a deÔ¨Ånitive store of super-accurate numbers. Rather, it‚Äôs intended to illustrate how to use approximate numbers as a part of constructive consensual conversations.</p><p>In the calculations, I‚Äôll mainly use the United Kingdom and occasionally Europe, America, or the whole world, but you should Ô¨Ånd it easy to redo the calculations for whatever country or region you are interested in.</p><p>Let me close this chapter with a few more warnings to the reader. Not only will we make a habit of approximating the numbers we calculate; we‚Äôll also neglect all sorts of details that investors, managers, and economists have to attend to, poor folks. If you‚Äôre trying to launch a renewable technology, just a 5% increase in costs may make all the difference between success and failure, so in business every detail must be tracked. But 5% is too small for this book‚Äôs radar. This is a book about factors of 2 and factors of 10. It‚Äôs about physical limits to sustainable energy, not current economic feasibility. While economics is always changing, the fundamental limits won‚Äôt ever go away.

Distinguishing energy and power. Each of these 60W light bulbs has a <span>power</span> of 60W when switched on; it doesn‚Äôt have an &quot;energy&quot; of 60W. The bulb uses 60W of electrical <span>power</span> when it‚Äôs on; it emits 60 W of <span>power</span> in the form of light and heat (mainly the latter).<p>Most discussions of energy consumption and production are confusing because of the proliferation of <em>units</em> in which energy and power are measured, from &quot;tons of oil equivalent&quot; to &quot;terawatt-hours&quot; (TWh) and &quot;exajoules&quot; (EJ). Nobody but a specialist has a feeling for what &quot;a barrel of oil&quot; or &quot;a million BTUs&quot; means in human terms. In this book, we‚Äôll express everything in a single set of personal units that everyone can relate to.</p><p>The unit of <strong>energy</strong> I have chosen is the kilowatt-hour (kWh). This quantity is called &quot;one unit&quot; on electricity bills, and it costs a domestic user about 10p in the UK in 2008. As we‚Äôll see, most individual daily choices involve amounts of energy equal to small numbers of kilowatt-hours.</p><p>When we discuss <strong>powers</strong> (rates at which we use or produce energy), the main unit will be the kilowatt-hour per day (kWh/d). We‚Äôll also occasionally use the watt (40 W ‚âà 1kWh/d) and the kilowatt (1¬†kW = 1000 W = 24¬†kWh/d), as I‚Äôll explain below. The kilowatt-hour per day is a nice human-sized unit: most personal energy-guzzling activities guzzle at a rate of a small number of kilowatt-hours per day. For example, one 40 W lightbulb, kept switched on all the time, uses <strong>one</strong> kilowatt-hour per day. Some electricity companies include graphs in their electricity bills, showing energy consumption in kilowatt-hours per day. I‚Äôll use the same unit for all forms of power, not just electricity. Petrol consumption, gas consumption, coal consumption: I‚Äôll measure all these powers in kilowatthours per day. Let me make this clear: for some people, the word &quot;power&quot; means only <em>electrical</em> energy consumption. But this book concerns <em>all</em> forms of energy consumption and production, and I will use the word &quot;power&quot; for all of them.</p><p>One kilowatt-hour per day is roughly the power you could get from one human servant.

If you want a drink of water, you want a <em>volume</em> of water ‚Äì one litre, perhaps (if you‚Äôre thirsty). When you turn on a tap, you create a <em><span class="mauve">Ô¨Çow</span></em> of water ‚Äì <span class="mauve">one litre per minute</span>, say, if the tap yields only a trickle; or 10 litres per minute, from a more generous tap. You can get the same <span class="darkblue">volume</span> (one litre) either by running the trickling tap for one minute, or by running the generous tap for one tenth of a minute. The <em><span class="darkblue">volume</span></em> delivered in a particular time is equal to the <em><span class="mauve">Ô¨Çow</span></em> multiplied by the <em><span class="red">time:</span></em></p><span class="darkblue">volume</span> = <span class="mauve">Ô¨Çow</span> √ó <span class="red">time.</span><p>We say that a <em>Ô¨Çow</em> is a <em>rate</em> at which <em>volume</em> is delivered. If you know the volume delivered in a particular time, you get the Ô¨Çow by dividing the volume by the time:</p><span class="mauve">Ô¨Çow</span> = <span class="darkblue">volume</span> / <span class="red">time.</span><span class="darkblue">energy</span>is measured in<span class="darkblue">kWh</span> or <span class="darkblue">MJ</span><span class="mauve">power</span>is measured in<span class="mauve">kWh per day</span>or <span class="mauve">kW</span>or <span class="mauve">W</span> (watts) or <span class="mauve">MW</span> (megawatts) or <span class="mauve">GW</span> (gigawatts) or <span class="mauve">TW</span> (terawatts)<p>Here‚Äôs the connection to energy and power. <em><span class="darkblue">Energy</span></em> is like water <em><span class="darkblue">volume</span></em>: <em><span class="mauve">power</span></em> is like water <em><span class="mauve">Ô¨Çow</span></em>. For example, whenever a toaster is switched on, it starts to consume <em><span class="mauve">power</span></em> at a rate of one kilowatt. It continues to consume one kilowatt until it is switched off. To put it another way, the toaster (if it‚Äôs left on permanently) consumes one kilowatt-hour (kWh) of energy per hour; it also consumes 24 kilowatt-hours per day.</p><p>The longer the toaster is on, the more <span class="darkblue">energy</span> it uses. You can work out the energy used by a particular activity by multiplying the power by the duration:</p><span class="darkblue">energy</span>= <span class="mauve">power</span> √ó <span class="red">time</span>.<p>The joule is the standard international unit of energy, but sadly it‚Äôs far too small to work with. The kilowatt-hour is equal to 3.6¬†million joules (3.6¬†megajoules).</p><p>Powers are so useful and important, they have something that water Ô¨Çows don‚Äôt have: they have their own special units. When we talk of a Ô¨Çow, we might measure it in &quot;litres per minute,&quot; &quot;gallons per hour,&quot; or &quot;cubic-metres per second;&quot; these units‚Äô names make clear that the Ô¨Çow is &quot;a volume per unit time.&quot; A power of <em>one joule per second</em> is called <em>one watt</em>. 1000 joules per second is called one kilowatt. Let‚Äôs get the terminology straight: the toaster uses one kilowatt. It doesn‚Äôt use &quot;one kilowatt per second.&quot; The &quot;per second&quot; is already built in to the deÔ¨Ånition of the kilowatt: one kilowatt means &quot;one kilojoule per second.&quot;<sup id="fnref-ch02n01"><a class="jsx-1614200154 footnote-ref" href="/sewtha#fn-ch02n01">ch02n01</a></sup> Similarly we say &quot;a nuclear power station generates one gigawatt.&quot; One gigawatt, by the way, is one billion watts, one million kilowatts, or 1000¬†megawatts. So one gigawatt is a million toasters. And the &quot;g&quot;s in gigawatt are pronounced hard, the same as in &quot;giggle.&quot; And, while I‚Äôm tapping the blackboard, we capitalize the &quot;g&quot; and &quot;w&quot; in &quot;gigawatt&quot; only when we write the abbreviation &quot;GW.&quot;</p><p>Please, never, ever say &quot;one kilowatt per second,&quot;<sup id="fnref-ch02n02"><a class="jsx-1614200154 footnote-ref" href="/sewtha#fn-ch02n02">ch02n02</a></sup> &quot;one kilowatt per hour,&quot; or &quot;one kilowatt per day;&quot; none of these is a valid measure of power. The urge that people have to say &quot;per something&quot; when talking about their toasters is one of the reasons I decided to use the &quot;kilowatt-hour per day&quot; as my unit of power. I‚Äôm sorry that it‚Äôs a bit cumbersome to say and to write.</p><p>1TWh (one terawatt-hour) is equal to one billion kWh.</p><span id="chap02.xhtml#page26">Here‚Äôs</span>¬†one last thing to make clear: if I say &quot;someone used a gigawatthour of energy,&quot; I am simply telling you *how much* energy they used, not *how fast* they used it. Talking about a gigawatt-hour *doesn‚Äôt* imply the energy was used *in one hour*. You could use a gigawatt-hour of energy by switching on one million toasters for one hour, or by switching on 1000 toasters for 1000 hours.<p>As I said, I‚Äôll usually quote powers in kWh/d <em>per person</em>. One reason for liking these personal units is that it makes it much easier to move from talking about the UK to talking about other countries or regions. For example, imagine we are discussing waste incineration and we learn that UK waste incineration delivers a power of 7 TWh per year and that Denmark‚Äôs waste incineration delivers 10 TWh per year. Does this help us say whether Denmark incinerates &quot;more&quot; waste than the UK? While the total power produced from waste in each country may be interesting, I think that what we usually want to know is the waste incineration <em>per person</em>. (For the record, that is: Denmark, 5¬†kWh/d per person; UK, 0.3¬†kWh/d per person. So Danes incinerate about 13 times as much waste as Brits.) To save ink, I‚Äôll sometimes abbreviate &quot;per person&quot; to &quot;/p&quot;. By discussing everything per-person from the outset, we end up with a more transportable book, one that will hopefully be useful for sustainable energy discussions worldwide.</p><h2 id="picky-details">Picky details</h2><h4 id="isnt-energy-conserved-we-talk-about-using-energy-but-doesnt-one-of-the-laws-of-nature-say-that-energy-cant-be-created-or-destroyed">Isn‚Äôt energy conserved? We talk about &quot;using&quot; energy, but doesn‚Äôt one of the laws of nature say that energy can‚Äôt be created or destroyed?</h4><p>Yes, I‚Äôm being imprecise. This is really a book about <em>entropy</em> ‚Äì a trickier thing to explain. When we &quot;use up&quot; one kilojoule of energy, what we‚Äôre really doing is taking one kilojoule of energy in a form that has <em>low entropy</em> (for example, electricity), and <em>converting</em> it into an exactly equal amount of energy in another form, usually one that has much higher entropy (for example, hot air or hot water). When we‚Äôve &quot;used&quot; the energy, it‚Äôs still there; but we normally can‚Äôt &quot;use&quot; the energy over and over again, because only <em>low entropy</em> energy is &quot;useful&quot; to us. Sometimes these different grades of energy are distinguished by adding a label to the units: one kWh(e) is one kilowatt-hour of electrical energy ‚Äì the highest grade of energy. One kWh(th) is one kilowatt-hour of thermal energy ‚Äì for example the energy in ten litres of boiling-hot water. Energy lurking in higher-temperature things is more useful (lower entropy) than energy in tepid things. A third grade of energy is chemical energy. Chemical energy is high-grade energy like electricity.</p><p>It‚Äôs a convenient but sloppy shorthand to talk about the energy rather than the entropy, and that is what we‚Äôll do most of the time in this book. Occasionally, we‚Äôll have to smarten up this sloppiness; for example, when we discuss refrigeration, power stations, heat pumps, or geothermal power.</p><h4 id="are-you-comparing-apples-and-oranges-is-it-valid-to-compare-different-forms-of-energy-such-as-the-chemical-energy-that-is-fed-into-a-petrolpowered-car-and-the-electricity-from-a-wind-turbine">Are you comparing apples and oranges? Is it valid to compare different forms of energy such as the chemical energy that is fed into a petrolpowered car and the electricity from a wind turbine?</h4><p>By comparing consumed energy with conceivable produced energy, I do not wish to imply that all forms of energy are equivalent and interchangeable. The electrical energy produced by a wind turbine is of no use to a petrol engine; and petrol is no use if you want to power a television. In principle, energy can be converted from one form to another, though conversion entails losses. Fossil-fuel power stations, for example, guzzle <em>chemical energy</em> and produce <em>electricity</em> (with an efÔ¨Åciency of 40% or so). And aluminium plants guzzle <em>electrical energy</em> to create a product with high <em>chemical energy</em> ‚Äì aluminium (with an efÔ¨Åciency of 30% or so).</p><p>In some summaries of energy production and consumption, all the different forms of energy are put into the same units, but multipliers are introduced, rating electrical energy from hydroelectricity for example as being worth 2.5 times more than the chemical energy in oil. This bumping up of electricity‚Äôs effective energy value can be justiÔ¨Åed by saying, &quot;well, 1¬†kWh of electricity is equivalent to 2.5¬†kWh of oil, because if we put that much oil into a standard power station it would deliver 40% of 2.5¬†kWh, which is 1¬†kWh of electricity.&quot; In this book, however, I will usually use a one-to-one conversion rate when comparing different forms of energy. It is <em>not</em> the case that 2.5¬†kWh of oil is inescapably equivalent to 1¬†kWh of electricity; that just happens to be the perceived exchange rate in a worldview where oil is used to make electricity. Yes, conversion of chemical energy to electrical energy is done with this particular inefÔ¨Åcient exchange rate. But electrical energy can also be converted to chemical energy. In an alternative world (perhaps not far-off) with relatively plentiful electricity and little oil, we might use electricity to make liquid fuels; in that world we would surely not use the same exchange rate ‚Äì each kWh of gasoline would then cost us something like 3¬†kWh of electricity<!-- -->!<!-- --> I think the timeless and scientiÔ¨Åc way to summarize and compare energies is to hold 1¬†kWh of chemical energy equivalent to 1¬†kWh of electricity. My choice to use this one-to-one conversion rate means that some of my sums will look a bit different from other people‚Äôs. (For example, BP‚Äôs <em>Statistical Review of World Energy</em> rates 1¬†kWh of electricity as equivalent to 100/38 ‚âà 2.6¬†kWh of oil; on the other hand, the government‚Äôs <em>Digest of <span id="chap02.xhtml#DUKES">UK Energy</span> Statistics</em> uses the same one-to-one conversion rate as me.) And I emphasize again, this choice does not imply that I‚Äôm suggesting you could convert either form of energy directly into the other. Converting chemical energy into electrical energy always wastes energy, and so does converting electrical into chemical energy.</p><h2 id="physics-and-equations">Physics and equations</h2><p>Throughout the book, my aim is not only to work out numbers indicating our current energy consumption and conceivable sustainable <span id="chap02.xhtml#page28">production</span>,but also to make clear <em>what these numbers depend on</em>. Understanding what the numbers depend on is essential if we are to choose sensible policies to change any of the numbers. Only if we understand the physics behind energy consumption and energy production can we assess assertions such as &quot;cars waste 99% of the energy they consume; we could redesign cars so that they use 100 times less energy.&quot; Is this assertion true? To explain the answer, I will need to use equations like</p><p>kinetic energy = ¬Ω<em>mv</em><sup>2</sup></p><p>However, I recognize that to many readers, such formulae are a foreign language. So, here‚Äôs my promise: <em>I‚Äôll keep all this foreign-language stuff in technical chapters at the end of the book</em>.

On those grounds, I should certainly go ahead, industrialize the countryside, and push the PV farm onto the stack. At the same time, I want to help people figure out what we should be doing between <em>now</em> and 2050. And today, electricity from solar farms would be four times as expensive as the market rate.

Burning by-products is coal substitution again, but using ordinary plants, not the best high-energy plants. A power station that burns agricultural by-products won‚Äôt deliver as much power per unit area of farmland as an optimized biomass-growing facility, but it has the <span id="chap06.xhtml#page43">advantage</span> that it doesn‚Äôt monopolize the land. Burning methane gas from landfill sites is a similar way of getting energy, but it‚Äôs sustainable only as long as we have a sustainable source of junk to keep putting into the landfill sites.

Archer and Barber suggest that by genetic modification, it might be possible to improve the storage efficiency of plants, especially <em>C4 plants</em>, which have already naturally evolved a more efficient photosynthetic pathway. C4 plants are mainly found in the tropics and thrive in high temperatures; they don‚Äôt grow at temperatures below 10¬∞C. Some examples of C4 plants are sugarcane, maize, sorghum, finger millet, and switchgrass. Zhu et al. (2008) calculate that the theoretical limit for the conversion efficiency of solar energy to biomass is 4.6% for C3 photosynthesis at 30¬∞C and today‚Äôs 380 ppm atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> concentration, and 6% for C4 photosynthesis. They say that the highest solar energy conversion efficiencies reported for C3 and C4 crops are 2.4% and 3.7% respectively; and, citing Boyer (1982), that the average conversion efficiencies of major crops in the US are 3 or 4 times lower than those record efficiencies (that is, about 1% efficient). One reason that plants don‚Äôt achieve the theoretical limit is that they have insufficient capacity to use all the incoming radiation of bright sunlight. Both these papers (Zhu et al., 2008; Boyer, 1982) discuss prospects for genetic engineering of more-efficient plants.</p><p><img src="/img/sewtha/figure53.gif"/></p><span class="figurenumber">Figure 7.1</span>.

How does the extra power required by that policy compare with the power already being used to trundle the car around? Let‚Äôs say the car has four incandescent lights totalling 100 W.

To obtain this average power requires roughly 10 000 &quot;3 MW&quot; wind turbines like those in figure 10.1. (They have a capacity of &quot;3 MW&quot; but on average they deliver 1 MW. I pop quotes round &quot;3 MW&quot; to indicate that this is a capacity, a peak power.)</p><p>What would this &quot;33 GW&quot;‚Äô of power cost to erect?<sup id="fnref-ch10n11"><a class="jsx-1614200154 footnote-ref" href="/sewtha#fn-ch10n11">ch10n11</a></sup> Well, the &quot;90 MW&quot; Kentish Flats farm cost ¬£105¬†million, so &quot;33 GW&quot; would cost about ¬£33 billion. One way to clarify this ¬£33 billion cost of offshore wind delivering 4¬†kWh/d per person is to share it among the UK population; that comes out to ¬£550 per person. This is a much better deal, incidentally, than microturbines. A roof-mounted microturbine currently costs about ¬£1500 and, even at a very optimistic windspeed of 6¬†m/s, delivers only 1.6¬†kWh/d. In reality, in a typical urban location in England, such micro-turbines deliver 0.2¬†kWh per day.<sup id="fnref-ch10n12"><a class="jsx-1614200154 footnote-ref" href="/sewtha#fn-ch10n12">ch10n12</a></sup></p><p>Another bottleneck constraining the planting of wind turbines is the special ships required. To erect 10 000 wind turbines (&quot;33 GW&quot;) over a period of 10 years would require roughly 50 jack-up barges. These cost ¬£60¬†million each,<sup id="fnref-ch10n13"><a class="jsx-1614200154 footnote-ref" href="/sewtha#fn-ch10n13">ch10n13</a></sup> so an extra capital investment of ¬£3 billion would be required. Not a show-stopper compared with the ¬£33bn price tag already quoted, but the need for jack-up barges is certainly a detail that requires some forward planning.</p><h3 id="costs-to-birds">Costs to birds</h3><p>Do windmills kill &quot;huge numbers&quot; of birds? Wind farms recently got adverse publicity from Norway, where the wind turbines on Smola, a set of islands off the north-west coast, killed 9 white-tailed eagles in 10¬†months. I share the concern of BirdLife International for the welfare of rare birds. But I think, as always, it‚Äôs important to do the numbers. It‚Äôs been estimated that 30 000 birds per year are killed by wind turbines in Denmark, where windmills generate 19% of the electricity. Horror<!-- -->!<!-- --> Ban windmills<!-- -->!<!-- --> We also learn, moreover, that <em>traffic</em> kills <em>one million</em> birds per year in Denmark. Thirty-times-greater horror<!-- -->!<!-- --> Thirty-times-greater incentive to ban cars<!-- -->!<!-- --> And in Britain, 55¬†million birds per year are killed by <em>cats</em> (figure 10.6).</p><p>Going on emotions alone, I would like to live in a country with virtually no cars, virtually no windmills, and with plenty of cats and birds (with the cats that prey on birds perhaps being preyed upon by Norwegian whitetailed eagles, to even things up). But what I really hope is that decisions about cars and windmills are made by careful rational thought, not by emotions alone. Maybe we do need the windmills<!-- -->!</p><p><img src="/img/sewtha/figure73.gif"/></p><span class="figurenumber">Figure 10.6</span>. Birds lost in action.

The BBC News has been warning us of this since 2005:<sup id="fnref-ch11n01"><a class="jsx-1614200154 footnote-ref" href="/sewtha#fn-ch11n01">ch11n01</a></sup></p><p>&quot;The nuclear power stations will all be switched off in a few years. How can we keep Britain‚Äôs lights on? ... <strong>unplug your mobile-phone charger when it‚Äôs not in use.</strong>&quot;</p><p>Sadly, a year later, Britain hadn‚Äôt got the message, and the BBC was forced to report:</p><p>&quot;<strong>Britain tops energy waste league</strong>&quot;.</p><p>And how did this come about? The BBC rams the message home:</p><p>&quot;65% of UK consumers leave chargers on.&quot;</p><p>From the way reporters talk about these planet-destroying black objects, it‚Äôs clear that they are roughly as evil as Darth Vader. But how evil, exactly?</p><p>In this chapter we‚Äôll find out the truth about chargers. We‚Äôll also investigate their cousins in the gadget parade: computers, phones, and TVs. Digital set-top boxes. Cable modems. In this chapter we‚Äôll estimate the power used in running them and charging them, but not in manufacturing the toys in the first place ‚Äì we‚Äôll address that in the later chapter on &quot;stuff.&quot;</p><h2 id="the-truth-about-chargers">The truth about chargers</h2><p>Modern phone chargers, when left plugged in with no phone attached, use about half a watt.<sup id="fnref-ch11n02"><a class="jsx-1614200154 footnote-ref" href="/sewtha#fn-ch11n02">ch11n02</a></sup> In our preferred units, this is a power consumption of about <span class="red">0.01¬†kWh per day</span>. For anyone whose consumption stack is over 100¬†kWh per day, the BBC‚Äôs advice, <em>always unplug the phone charger</em>, could potentially reduce their energy consumption by one hundredth of one percent (if only they would do it).</p><p>Every little helps<!-- -->!</p><p>I don‚Äôt think so. Obsessively switching off the phone-charger is like bailing the Titanic with a teaspoon. Do switch it off, but please be aware how tiny a gesture it is. Let me put it this way:</p><p>All the energy saved in switching off your charger for one day is used up in <em>one second</em> of car-driving.</p><p>The energy saved in switching off the charger for <em>one year</em> is equal to the energy in a single hot bath.</p><p>Admittedly, some older chargers use more than half a watt ‚Äì if it‚Äôs warm to the touch, it‚Äôs probably using one watt or even three (figure 11.3). A three-watt-guzzling charger uses 0.07¬†kWh per day. I think that it‚Äôs a good idea to switch off such a charger ‚Äì it <em>will</em> save you three pounds per year. But don‚Äôt kid yourself that you‚Äôve &quot;done your bit&quot; by so doing. 3W is only a tiny fraction of total energy consumption.</p><p>OK, that‚Äôs enough bailing the Titanic with a teaspoon. Let‚Äôs find out where the electricity is really being used.</p><p><img src="/img/sewtha/figure80.gif"/></p><span class="figurenumber">Figure 11.3</span>. This wasteful cordless phone and its charger use 3 W when left plugged in. That‚Äôs 0.07¬†kWh/d.

The first column shows the power consumption when the device is actually being used ‚Äì for example, when a sound system is actually playing sound. The second column shows the consumption when the device is switched on, but sitting doing nothing. I was particularly shocked to find that a laser-printer sitting idle consumes 17 W ‚Äì the same as the average consumption of a fridge-freezer<!-- -->!<!-- --> The third column shows the consumption when the gadget is explicitly asked to go to sleep or standby. The fourth shows the consumption when it is completely switched off ‚Äì but still left plugged in to the mains. I‚Äôm showing all these powers in watts ‚Äì to convert back to our standard units, remember that 40 W is 1¬†kWh/d. A nice rule of thumb, by the way, is that each watt costs about one pound per year (assuming electricity costs 10p per kWh).</p><p>The biggest guzzlers are the computer, its screen, and the television, whose consumption is in the hundreds of watts, when on. Entertainment systems such as stereos and DVD players swarm in the computer‚Äôs wake, many of them consuming 10 W or so. A DVD player may cost just ¬£20 in the shop, but if you leave it switched on all the time, it‚Äôs costing you another ¬£10 per year. Some stereos and computer peripherals consume several watts even when switched off, thanks to their mains-transformers. To be sure that a gadget is truly off, you need to switch it off at the wall.</p><h3 id="powering-the-hidden-tendrils-of-the-information-age">Powering the hidden tendrils of the information age</h3><p>According to Jonathan Koomey (2007), the computer-servers in US datacentres and their associated plumbing (air conditioners, backup power systems, and so forth) consumed <span class="red">0.4¬†kWh per day per person</span> ‚Äì just over 1% of US electricity consumption.

The ‚Äòwasted‚Äô energy they put out heats my home, so it‚Äôs not wasted.&quot;</h4><p>This myth is <em>True</em> for a few people, but only during the winter; but <em>False</em> for most.</p><p>If your house is being heated by electricity through ordinary bar fires or blower heaters then, yes, it‚Äôs much the same as heating the house with any electricity-wasting appliances. But if you are in this situation, you should change the way you heat your house. Electricity is high-grade energy, and heat is low-grade energy. <em>It‚Äôs a waste to turn electricity into heat</em>. To be precise, if you make only one unit of heat from a unit of electricity, that‚Äôs a waste. Heaters called air-source heat pumps or ground-source heat pumps can do much better, delivering 3 or 4 units of heat for every unit of electricity consumed. They work like back-to-front refrigerators, pumping heat into your house from the outside air (see Chapter 21).</p><p>For the rest, whose homes are heated by fossil fuels or biofuels, it‚Äôs a good idea to avoid using electrical gadgets as a heat source for your home ‚Äì at least for as long as our increases in electricity-demand are served from fossil fuels. It‚Äôs better to burn the fossil fuel at home. The point is, if you use electricity from an ordinary fossil power station, more than half of the energy from the fossil fuel goes sadly up the cooling tower. Of the energy that gets turned into electricity, about 8% is lost in the transmission system. If you burn the fossil fuel in your home, more of the energy goes directly into making hot air for you.</p><h2 id="notes-and-further-reading-10">Notes and further reading</h2><p><img src="/img/sewtha/figure82.gif"/></p><span class="figurenumber">Figure 11.6</span>.

The warmed water warms the air above it, and produces water vapour. The warmed air rises; as it rises it cools, and the water eventually re-condenses, forming clouds and rain. At its highest point, the air is cooled down further by the freezing blackness of space. The cold air sinks again. This great solarpowered pump drives air round and round in great convection rolls. From our point of view on the surface, these convection rolls produce the winds. Wind is second-hand solar energy. As wind rushes across open water, it generates waves. Waves are thus third-hand solar energy. (The waves that crash on a beach are nothing to do with the tides.)</p><p>In open water, waves are generated whenever the wind speed is greater than about 0.5¬†m/s. The wave crests move at about the speed of the wind that creates them, and in the same direction.<sup id="fnref-ch12n01"><a class="jsx-1614200154 footnote-ref" href="/sewtha#fn-ch12n01">ch12n01</a></sup> The <em>wavelength</em> of the waves (the distance between crests) and the <em>period</em> (the time between crests) depend on the speed of the wind. The longer the wind blows for, and the greater the expanse of water over which the wind blows, the greater the <em>height</em> of the waves stroked up by the wind. Thus since the prevailing winds over the Atlantic go from west to east, the waves arriving on the Atlantic coast of Europe are often especially big. (The waves on the east coast of the British Isles are usually much smaller,<sup id="fnref-ch12n02"><a class="jsx-1614200154 footnote-ref" href="/sewtha#fn-ch12n02">ch12n02</a></sup> so my estimates of potential wave power will focus on the resource in the Atlantic Ocean.)</p><p>Waves have long memory and will keep going in the same direction for days after the wind stopped blowing, until they bump into something. In seas where the direction of the wind changes frequently, waves born on different days form a superposed jumble, travelling in different directions.</p><p>If waves travelling in a particular direction encounter objects that absorb energy from the waves ‚Äì for example, a row of islands with sandy beaches ‚Äì then the seas beyond the object are calmer. The objects cast a shadow, and there‚Äôs less energy in the waves that get by. So, whereas sunlight delivers a power per unit <em>area</em>, waves deliver a power per unit <em>length</em> of coastline. You can‚Äôt have your cake and eat it. You can‚Äôt collect wave energy two miles off-shore <em>and</em> one mile off-shore. Or rather, you can try, but the two-mile facility will absorb energy that would have gone to the one-mile facility, and it won‚Äôt be replaced. The fetch required for wind to stroke up big waves is thousands of miles.</p><p>We can find an upper bound on the maximum conceivable power that could be obtained from wave power by estimating the incoming power <span id="chap12.xhtml#page74">per unit</span> length of exposed coastline, and multiplying by the length of coastline.

As I write, there are just three wave machines working in deep water: three Pelamis wave energy collectors (figure 12.1) built in Scotland and deployed off Portugal. No actual performance results have been published, but the makers of the Pelamis (&quot;designed with survival as the key objective before power capture efficiency&quot;) predict that a two-kilometre long wave-farm consisting of 40 of their sea-snakes would deliver 6¬†kW per metre of wave-farm. Using this number in the previous calculation, the power delivered by 500 kilometres of wave-farm is reduced to <span class="green">1.2¬†kWh per day per person</span>. While wave power may be useful for small communities on remote islands, I suspect it can‚Äôt play a significant role in the solution to Britain‚Äôs sustainable energy problem.</p><p>What‚Äôs the weight of a Pelamis, and how much steel does it contain? One snake with a maximum power of 750¬†kW weighs 700 tons, including 350 tons of ballast. So it has about 350 tons of steel. That‚Äôs a weight-to-power ratio of roughly 500 kg per kW (peak). We can compare this with the steel requirements for offshore wind: an offshore wind-turbine with a maximum power of 3 MW weighs 500 tons, including its foundation. That‚Äôs a weight-to-power ratio of about 170 kg per kW, one third of the wave machine‚Äôs. The Pelamis is a first prototype; presumably with further investment and development in wave technology, the weight-to-power ratio would fall.</p><p><img src="/img/sewtha/figure86.gif"/></p><span class="figurenumber">Figure 12.2</span>.

A &quot;Calorie,&quot; in food circles, is actually 1000 chemist‚Äôs calories (1 kcal). 2600 &quot;Calories&quot; per day is about 3¬†kWh per day. Most of this energy eventually escapes from the body as heat, so one function of a typical person is to act as a space heater with an output of a little over 100 W, a medium-power lightbulb. Put 10 people in a small cold room, and you can switch off the 1¬†kW convection heater.</p><p>How much energy do we actually consume in order to get our 3¬†kWh per day? If we enlarge our viewpoint to include the inevitable upstream costs of food production, then we may find that our energy footprint is substantially bigger.

Oh, hang on ‚Äì I love cheese too. And to make 1 kg of Irish Cheddar takes about 9 kg of milk. So consuming 50 g of cheese per day requires the production of an extra 450 g of milk. OK: my milk and cheese habit requires that I employ <sup>1</sup>‚ÅÑ<sub>16</sub> of a cow. And how much power does it take to run a cow? Well, if a cow weighing 450 kg has similar energy requirements per kilogram to a human (whose 65 kg burns 3¬†kWh per day) then the cow must be using about 21¬†kWh/d. Does this extrapolation from human to cow make you uneasy?

It depends on where the animals feed. Take the steep hills and mountains of Wales, for example. Could the land be used for anything other than grazing? Either these rocky pasturelands are used to sustain sheep, or they are not used to help feed humans. You can think of these natural green slopes as maintenance-free biofuel plantations, and the sheep as automated self-replicating biofuel harvesting machines. The energy losses between sunlight and mutton are substantial, but there is probably no better way of capturing solar power in such places. (I‚Äôm not sure whether this argument for sheep-farming in Wales actually adds up: during the worst weather, Welsh sheep are moved to lower fields where their diet is supplemented with soya feed and other food grown with the help of energy-intensive fertilizers; what‚Äôs the true energy cost? I don‚Äôt know.) Similar arguments can be made in favour of carnivory for places such as the scrublands of Africa and the grasslands of Australia; and in favour of dairy consumption in India, where millions of cows are fed on by-products of rice and maize farming.</p><p>On the other hand, where animals are reared in cages and fed grain that humans could have eaten, there‚Äôs no question that it would be more energy-efficient to cut out the middlehen or middlesow, and feed the grain directly to humans.</p><p><img src="/img/sewtha/figure94.gif"/></p><span class="figurenumber">Figure 13.7</span>.

Together they tour the sun once every year, at the same time whirling around each other once every 28 days. The moon also turns around once every 28 days so that she always shows the same face to her dancing partner, the earth. The prima donna earth doesn‚Äôt return the compliment; she pirouettes once every day. This dance is held together by the force of gravity: every bit of the earth, moon, and sun is pulled towards every other bit of earth, moon, and sun. The sum of all these forces is <em>almost</em> exactly what‚Äôs required to keep the whirling dance on course. But there are very slight imbalances between the gravitational forces and the forces required to maintain the dance. It is these imbalances that give rise to the tides.</p><p><img src="/img/sewtha/figure96.gif"/></p><span class="figurenumber">Figure 14.1</span>. An ocean covering a billiard-ball earth. We‚Äôre looking down on the North pole, and the moon is 60 cm off the page to the right. The earth spins once per day inside a rugby-ball-shaped shell of water. The oceans are stretched towards and away from the moon because the gravitational forces supplied by the moon don‚Äôt perfectly match the required centripetal force to keep the earth and moon whirling around their common centre of gravity. Someone standing on the equator (rotating as indicated by the arrow) will experience two high waters and two low waters per day.<p>The imbalances associated with the whirling of the moon and earth around each other are about three times as big as the imbalances associated with the earth‚Äôs slower dance around the sun, so the size of the tides varies with the phase of the moon, as the moon and sun pass in and out of alignment. At full moon and new moon (when the moon and sun are in line with each other) the imbalances reinforce each other, and the resulting big tides are called <em>spring tides</em>. (Spring tides are <em>not</em> &quot;tides that occur at spring-time;&quot; spring tides happen every two weeks like clockwork.) At the intervening half moons, the imbalances partly cancel and the tides are smaller; these smaller tides are called <em>neap tides</em>. Spring tides have roughly twice the amplitude of neap tides: the spring high tides are twice as high above mean sea level as neap high tides, the spring low tides are twice as low as neap low tides, and the tidal currents are twice as big at springs as at neaps.</p><p>Why are there two high tides and two low tides per day? Well, if the earth were a perfect sphere, a smooth billiard ball covered by oceans, the tidal effect of the earth-moon whirling would be to deform the water slightly towards and away from the moon, making the water slightly rugby-ball shaped (figure 14.1). Someone living on the equator of this billiard-ball earth, spinning round once per day within the water cocoon, would notice the water level going up and down twice per day: up once as he passed under the nose of the rugby-ball, and up a second time as he passed under its tail. This cartoon explanation is some way from reality. In reality, the earth is not smooth, and it is not uniformly covered by water (as you may have noticed). Two humps of water cannot whoosh round the earth once per day because the continents get in the way. The true behaviour of the tides is thus more complicated. In a large body of water such as the Atlantic Ocean, tidal crests and troughs form but, unable to whoosh round the earth, they do the next best thing: they whoosh around the perimeter of the Ocean. In the North Atlantic there are two crests and two troughs, all circling the Atlantic in an anticlockwise direction once a day. Here in Britain we don‚Äôt directly see these Atlantic crests and troughs ‚Äì we are set back from the Atlantic proper, separated from it by a few hundred miles of paddling pool called the continental shelf. Each time one of the crests whooshes by in the Atlantic proper, it sends a crest up our paddling pool. Similarly each Atlantic trough sends a trough up the paddling pool. Consecutive crests and troughs are separated by six hours. Or to be more precise, by six and a quarter hours, since the time between moon-rises is about 25, not 24 hours.</p><p><img src="/img/sewtha/figure97.gif"/></p><span class="figurenumber">Figure 14.2</span>.

The pool was filled at high tide, and now it‚Äôs low tide. We let the water out through the electricity generator to turn the water‚Äôs potential energy into electricity.[^ch14n01]<p>The speed at which the crests and troughs travel varies with the depth of the paddling pool. The shallower the paddling pool gets, the slower the crests and troughs travel and the larger they get. Out in the ocean, the tides are just a foot or two in height. Arriving in European estuaries, the tidal range is often as big as four metres. In the northern hemisphere, the Coriolis force (a force, associated with the rotation of the earth, that acts only on moving objects) makes all tidal crests and troughs tend to hug the right-hand bank as they go. For example, the tides in the English channel are bigger on the French side. Similarly, the crests and troughs entering the North Sea around the Orkneys hug the British side, travelling down to the Thames Estuary then turning left at the Netherlands to pay their respects to Denmark.</p><p>Tidal energy is sometimes called lunar energy, since it‚Äôs mainly thanks to the moon that the water sloshes around so. Much of the tidal energy, however, is really coming from the rotational energy of the spinning earth. The earth is very gradually slowing down.</p><p>So, how can we put tidal energy to use, and how much power could we extract?</p><h2 id="rough-estimates-of-tidal-power">Rough estimates of tidal power</h2><p>When you think of tidal power, you might think of an artificial pool next to the sea, with a water-wheel that is turned as the pool fills or empties (figures 14.2 and 14.3). Chapter G shows how to estimate the power available from such tide-pools. Assuming a range of 4¬†m, a typical range in many European estuaries, the maximum power of an artificial tide-pool that‚Äôs filled rapidly at high tide and emptied rapidly at low tide, generating power from both flow directions, is about <span class="green">3 W/m<sup>2</sup></span>. This is the same as the power per unit area of an offshore wind farm. And we already know how big offshore wind farms need to be to make a difference. <em>They need to be country-sized</em>. So similarly, to make tide-pools capable of producing power comparable to Britain‚Äôs total consumption, we‚Äôd need the total area of the tide-pools to be similar to the area of Britain.</p><table><thead><tr><th>tidal range</th><th>power density</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>2¬†m</td><td>1 W/m<sup>2</sup></td></tr><tr><td>4¬†m</td><td>3 W/m<sup>2</sup></td></tr><tr><td>6¬†m</td><td>7 W/m<sup>2</sup></td></tr><tr><td>8¬†m</td><td>13 W/m<sup>2</sup></td></tr></tbody></table><span class="figurenumber">Table 14.4</span>.

Because the density of water is roughly 1000 times that of air, the power of water flow is 1000 times greater than the power of wind at the same speed. We‚Äôll come back to tide farms in a moment, but first let‚Äôs discuss how much raw tidal energy rolls around Britain every day.</p><h3 id="span-idchap14xhtmltidal-powerspanraw-incoming-tidal-power"><span id="chap14.xhtml#tidal-power"></span>Raw incoming tidal power</h3><p><img src="/img/sewtha/figure100.gif"/></p><span class="figurenumber">Figure 14.6</span>. The average incoming power of lunar tidal waves crossing these two lines has been measured to be 250 GW. This raw power, shared between 60¬†million people, is 100¬†kWh per day per person.<p>The tides around Britain are genuine tidal waves ‚Äì unlike tsunamis, which are called &quot;tidal waves,&quot; but are nothing to do with tides. Follow a high tide as it rolls in from the Atlantic. The time of high tide becomes progressively later as we move east up the English channel from the Isles of Scilly to Portsmouth and on to Dover. The crest of the tidal wave progresses up the channel at about 70 km/h. (The crest of the wave moves much faster than the water itself, just as ordinary waves on the sea move faster than the water.) Similarly, a high tide moves clockwise round Scotland, rolling down the North Sea from Wick to Berwick and on to Hull at a speed of about 100 km/h. These two high tides converge on the Thames Estuary. By coincidence, the Scottish crest arrives about 12 hours later than the crest that came via Dover, so it arrives in near-synchrony with the next high tide via Dover, and London receives the normal two high tides per day.</p><p>The power we can extract from tides can never be more than the total power of these tidal waves from the Atlantic.

Now let‚Äôs estimate the power that could be delivered by three specific solutions: tide farms, barrages, and offshore tidal lagoons.</p><h2 id="tidal-stream-farms">Tidal stream farms</h2><p>One way to extract tidal energy would be to build tide farms, just like wind farms. The first such underwater windmill, or &quot;tidal-stream&quot; generator, to be connected to the grid was a &quot;300¬†kW&quot; turbine, installed in 2003 near the northerly city of Hammerfest, Norway. Detailed power production results have not been published, and no-one has yet built a tide farm with more than one turbine, so we‚Äôre going to have to rely on physics and guesswork to predict how much power tide farms could produce. Assuming that the rules for laying out a sensible tide farm are similar to those for wind farms, and that the efficiency of the tide turbines will be like that of the best wind turbines, table 14.7 shows the power of a tide farm for a few tidal currents.</p><table><tr class="lineabove2"><th class="tcell1 center" colspan="2"><p>speed</p></th><th class="tcell1 center"><p>power density</p></th></tr><tr class="linebelow2"><td class="tcell1 center"><p>(m/s)</p></td><td class="tcell1 center"><p>(knots)</p></td><td class="tcell1 center"><p>(W/m<sup>2</sup>)</p></td></tr><tr><td class="tcell1 center"><p>0.5</p></td><td class="tcell1 center"><p>1</p></td><td class="tcell1 center"><p>1</p></td></tr><tr><td class="tcell1 center"><p>1</p></td><td class="tcell1 center"><p>2</p></td><td class="tcell1 center"><p>8</p></td></tr><tr><td class="tcell1 center"><p>2</p></td><td class="tcell1 center"><p>4</p></td><td class="tcell1 center"><p>60</p></td></tr><tr><td class="tcell1 center"><p>3</p></td><td class="tcell1 center"><p>6</p></td><td class="tcell1 center"><p>200</p></td></tr><tr><td class="tcell1 center"><p>4</p></td><td class="tcell1 center"><p>8</p></td><td class="tcell1 center"><p>500</p></td></tr><tr class="linebelow2"><td class="tcell1 center"><p>5</p></td><td class="tcell1 center"><p>10</p></td><td class="tcell1 center"><p>1000</p></td></tr></table><span class="figurenumber">Table 14.7</span>.

The famous barrage at La Rance in France,<sup id="fnref-ch14n04"><a class="jsx-1614200154 footnote-ref" href="/sewtha#fn-ch14n04">ch14n04</a></sup> where the tidal range is a whopping 8¬†metres on average, has produced an average power of 60 MW since 1966. The tidal range in the Severn Estuary is also unusually large. At Cardiff the range is 11.3¬†m at spring tides, and 5.8¬†m at neaps. If a barrage were put across the mouth of the Severn Estuary (from Weston-super-Mare to Cardiff), it would make a 500 km<sup>2</sup> tide-pool (figure 14.8). Notice how much bigger this pool is than the estuary at La Rance. What power could this tide-pool deliver, if we let the water in and out at the ideal times, generating on both the flood and the ebb? According to the theoretical numbers from table 14.4, when the range is 11.3¬†m, the average power contributed by the barrage (at 30 W/m<sup>2</sup>) would be at most 14.5 GW, or <strong>5.8¬†kWh/d per person</strong>. When the range is 5.8¬†m, the average power contributed by the barrage (at 8 W/m<sup>2</sup>) would be at most 3.9 GW, or <strong>1.6¬†kWh/d per person</strong>. These numbers assume that the water is let in in a single pulse at the peak of high tide, and let out in a single pulse at low tide. In practice, the in-flow and out-flow would be spread over a few hours, which would reduce the power <span id="chap14.xhtml#page85">delivered</span> a little.</p><p><img src="/img/sewtha/figure1011.gif"/></p><span class="figurenumber">Figure 14.8</span>. The Severn barrage proposals (bottom left), and Strangford Lough, Northern Ireland (top left), shown on the same scale as the barrage at La Rance (bottom right). The map shows two proposed locations for a Severn barrage. A barrage at Weston-super-Mare would deliver an average power of 2 GW (0.8¬†kWh/d per person). The outer alternative would deliver twice as much. There is a big tidal resource in Northern Ireland at Strangford Lough. Strangford Lough‚Äôs area is 150 km<sup>2</sup>; the tidal range in the Irish Sea outside is 4.5¬†m at springs and 1.5¬†m at neaps ‚Äì sadly not as big as the range at La Rance or the Severn. The raw power of the natural tide-pool at Strangford Lough is roughly 150 MW, which, shared between the 1.7¬†million people of Northern Ireland, comes to 2¬†kWh/d per person. Strangford Lough is the location of the first grid-connected tidal stream generator in the UK.<p>The current proposals for the barrage will generate power in one direction only. This reduces the power delivered by another 50%.

Two tidal lagoons, each with an area of 400 km<sup>2</sup>, one off Blackpool, and one in the Wash. The Severn estuary is also highlighted for comparison.<p>Tidal lagoons are created by building walls in the sea; they can then be used like artificial estuaries. The required conditions for building lagoons are that the water must be shallow and the tidal range must be large. Economies of scale apply: big tidal lagoons make cheaper electricity than small ones. The two main locations for large tidal lagoons in Britain are the Wash on the east coast, and the waters off Blackpool on the west coast (figure 14.9). Smaller facilities could be built in north Wales, Lincolnshire, southwest Wales, and east Sussex.</p><p>If two lagoons are built in one location, a neat trick can be used to boost the power delivered and to enable the lagoons to deliver power on demand at any time, independent of the state of the tide. One lagoon can be designated the &quot;high&quot; lagoon, and the other the &quot;low&quot; lagoon. At low tide, some power generated by the emptying high lagoon can be used to pump water <em>out</em> of the low lagoon, making its level even lower than low water. The energy required to pump down the level of the low lagoon is then repaid with interest at high tide, when power is generated by letting water into the low lagoon. Similarly, extra water can be pumped into the high lagoon at high tide, using energy generated by the low lagoon. Whatever state the tide is in, one lagoon or the other would be able to generate power. Such a pair of tidal lagoons could also work as a pumped storage facility, storing excess energy from the electricity grid.</p><p>The average power per unit area of tidal lagoons in British waters could be <span class="green">4.5¬†W/m<sup>2</sup></span>,<sup id="fnref-ch14n06"><a class="jsx-1614200154 footnote-ref" href="/sewtha#fn-ch14n06">ch14n06</a></sup> so if tidal lagoons with a total area of 800 km<sup>2</sup> were created (as indicated in figure 14.9), the power generated would be <span class="green">1.5¬†kWh/d per person</span>.</p><h2 id="beauties-of-tide">Beauties of tide</h2><p>Totting everything up, the barrage, the lagoons, and the tidal stream farms could deliver something like <span class="green">11¬†kWh/d per person</span> (figure 14.10).</p><p>Tide power has never been used on an industrial scale in Britain, so it‚Äôs hard to know what economic and technical challenges will be raised as we build and maintain tide-turbines ‚Äì corrosion, silt accumulation, entanglement with flotsam? But here are seven reasons for being excited about tidal power in the British Isles. 1. Tidal power is completely predictable; unlike wind and sun, tidal power is a renewable on which one could depend; it works day and night all year round; using tidal lagoons, energy can be stored so that power can be delivered on demand. 2. Successive high and low tides take about 12 hours to progress around the British Isles, so the strongest currents off Anglesey, Islay, Orkney and Dover occur at different times from each other; thus, together, a collection of tide farms could produce a more constant contribution to the electrical grid than one tide farm, albeit a contribution that wanders up and down with the phase of the moon. 3. Tidal power will last for millions of years. 4. It doesn‚Äôt require high-cost hardware, in contrast to solar photovoltaic power. 5. Moreover, because the power density of a typical tidal flow is greater than the power density of a typical wind, a 1 MW tide turbine is smaller in size than a 1 MW wind turbine; perhaps tide turbines could therefore be cheaper than wind turbines. 6. Life below the waves is peaceful; there is no such thing as a freak tidal storm; so, unlike wind turbines, which require costly engineering to withstand rare windstorms, underwater tide turbines will not require big safety factors in their design. 7. Humans mostly live on the land, and they can‚Äôt see under the sea, so objections to the visual impact of tide turbines should be less strong than the objections to wind turbines.</p><h3 id="mythconceptions-4">Mythconceptions</h3><h4 id="tidal-power-while-clean-and-green-should-not-be-called-renewable-extracting-power-from-the-tides-slows-down-the-earths-rotation-we-definitely-cant-use-tidal-power-long-term">Tidal power, while clean and green, should not be called renewable. Extracting power from the tides slows down the earth‚Äôs rotation. We definitely can‚Äôt use tidal power long-term.</h4><p><em>False</em>. The natural tides already slow down the earth‚Äôs rotation. The natural rotational energy loss is roughly 3 TW (Shepherd, 2003). Thanks to natural tidal friction, each century, the day gets longer by 2.3¬†milliseconds. Many tidal energy extraction systems are just extracting energy that would have been lost anyway in friction. But even if we doubled the power extracted from the earth‚Äìmoon system, tidal energy would still last more than a billion years.</p><p><img src="/img/sewtha/figure103.gif"/></p><span class="figurenumber">Figure 14.10</span>.

Selfridges‚Äô rubbish advertisement.<h1 id="15---stuff">15¬†¬†¬†Stuff</h1><p>One of the main sinks of energy in the &quot;developed&quot; world is the creation of stuff. In its natural life cycle, stuff passes through three stages. First, a new-born stuff is displayed in shiny packaging on a shelf in a shop. At this stage, stuff is called &quot;goods.&quot; As soon as the stuff is taken home and sheds its packaging, it undergoes a transformation from &quot;goods&quot; to its second form, &quot;clutter.&quot; The clutter lives with its owner for a period of months or years. During this period, the clutter is largely ignored by its owner, who is off at the shops buying more goods. Eventually, by a miracle of modern alchemy, the clutter is transformed into its final form, rubbish. To the untrained eye, it can be difficult to distinguish this &quot;rubbish&quot; from the highly desirable &quot;good&quot; that it used to be. Nonetheless, at this stage the discerning owner pays the dustman to transport the stuff away.</p><p>Let‚Äôs say we want to understand the full energy-cost of a stuff, perhaps with a view to designing better stuff. This is called life-cycle analysis.

Usually one of these four phases dominates the total energy cost, so to get a reasonable estimate of the total energy cost we need accurate estimates only of the cost of that dominant phase.

Now Britain doesn‚Äôt manufacture so much (so our energy consumption and carbon emissions have dropped a bit), but we still love gizmos, and we get them made for us by other countries. Should we ignore the energy cost of making the gizmo, because it‚Äôs imported? I don‚Äôt think so. Dieter Helm and his colleagues in Oxford estimate that under a correct account, allowing for imports and exports, Britain‚Äôs carbon footprint is nearly <em>doubled</em> from the official &quot;11 tons CO<sub>2</sub>e per person&quot; to about 21 tons. This implies that the biggest item in the average British person‚Äôs energy footprint is the energy cost of making imported stuff.<sup id="fnref-ch15n15"><a class="jsx-1614200154 footnote-ref" href="/sewtha#fn-ch15n15">ch15n15</a></sup></p><p>In Chapter H, I explore this idea further, by looking at the weight of Britain‚Äôs imports. Leaving aside our imports of fuels, we import a little over 2 tons per person of stuff every year, of which about 1.3 tons per person are processed and manufactured stuff like vehicles, machinery, white goods, and electrical and electronic equipment. That‚Äôs about 4 kg per day per person of processed stuff. Such goods are mainly made of materials whose production required at least 10¬†kWh of energy per kg of stuff.

Some granite.<h1 id="16---geothermal">16¬†¬†¬†Geothermal</h1><p>Geothermal energy comes from two sources: from radioactive decay in the crust of the earth, and from heat trickling through the mantle from the earth‚Äôs core. The heat in the core is there because the earth used to be red-hot, and it‚Äôs still cooling down and solidifying; the heat in the core is also being topped up by tidal friction: the earth flexes in response to the gravitational fields of the moon and sun, in the same way that an orange changes shape if you squeeze it and roll it between your hands.</p><p>Geothermal is an attractive renewable because it is &quot;always on,&quot; independent of the weather; if we make geothermal power stations, we can switch them on and off so as to follow demand.</p><p>But how much geothermal power is available? We could estimate geothermal power of two types: the power available at an ordinary location on the earth‚Äôs crust; and the power available in special hot spots like Iceland (figure 16.3). While the right place to first develop geothermal technology is definitely the special hot spots, I‚Äôm going to assume that the greater total resource comes from the ordinary locations, since ordinary locations are so much more numerous.</p><p>The difficulty with making <em>sustainable</em> geothermal power is that the speed at which heat travels through solid rock limits the rate at which heat can be sustainably sucked out of the red-hot interior of the earth. It‚Äôs like trying to drink a crushed-ice drink through a straw. You stick in the straw, and suck, and you get a nice mouthful of cold liquid. But after a little more sucking, you find you‚Äôre sucking air. You‚Äôve extracted all the liquid from the ice around the tip of the straw. Your initial rate of sucking wasn‚Äôt sustainable.</p><p>If you stick a straw down a 15-km hole in the earth, you‚Äôll find it‚Äôs nice and hot there, easily hot enough to boil water. So, you could stick two straws down, and pump cold water down one straw and suck from the other. You‚Äôll be sucking up steam, and you can run a power station. Limitless power? No. After a while, your sucking of heat out of the rock will have reduced the temperature of the rock. You weren‚Äôt sucking sustainably. You now have a long wait before the rock at the tip of your straws warms up again. A possible attitude to this problem is to treat geothermal heat the same way we currently treat fossil fuels: as a resource to be mined rather than collected sustainably. Living off geothermal heat in this way might be better for the planet than living unsustainably off fossil fuels; but perhaps it would only be another stop-gap giving us another 100 years of unsustainable living? In this book I‚Äôm most interested in <em>sustainable</em> energy, as the title hinted. Let‚Äôs do the sums.</p><p><img src="/img/sewtha/figure115.gif"/></p><span class="figurenumber">Figure 16.3</span>. Geothermal power in Iceland.

Sucking at such a rate that the rocks at the end of the our straws don‚Äôt get colder and colder. This means sucking at the natural rate at which heat is already flowing out of the earth.</p><p>one milliwatt (1¬†mW) is 0.001 W.</p><p><img src="/img/sewtha/figure118.gif"/></p><span class="figurenumber">Figure 16.4</span>. Temperature profile in a typical continent.<p><img src="/img/sewtha/figure119.gif"/></p><span class="figurenumber">Figure 16.5</span>. Enhanced geothermal extraction from hot dry rock. One well is drilled and pressurized to create fractures. A second well is drilled into the far side of the fracture zone. Then cold water is pumped down one well and heated water (indeed, steam) is sucked up the other.<p>As I said before, geothermal energy comes from two sources: from radioactive decay in the crust of the earth, and from heat trickling through the mantle from the earth‚Äôs core. In a typical continent, the heat flow from the centre coming through the mantle is about 10¬†mW/m<sup>2</sup>. The heat flow at the surface is 50¬†mW/m<sup>2</sup>.<sup id="fnref-ch16n01"><a class="jsx-1614200154 footnote-ref" href="/sewtha#fn-ch16n01">ch16n01</a></sup> So the radioactive decay has added an extra 40¬†mW/m<sup>2</sup> to the heat flow from the centre.</p><p>So at a typical location, the maximum power we can get per unit area is 50¬†mW/m<sup>2</sup>. But that power is not high-grade power, it‚Äôs low-grade heat that‚Äôs trickling through at the ambient temperature up here. We presumably want to make electricity, and that‚Äôs why we must drill down. Heat is useful only if it comes from a source at a higher temperature than the ambient temperature. The temperature increases with depth as shown in figure 16.4, reaching a temperature of about 500 ¬∞C at a depth of 40 km. Between depths of 0 km where the heat flow is biggest but the rock temperature is too low, and 40 km, where the rocks are hottest but the heat flow is 5 times smaller (because we‚Äôre missing out on all the heat generated from radioactive decay) there is an optimal depth at which we should suck. The exact optimal depth depends on what sort of sucking and powerstation machinery we use. We can bound the maximum sustainable power by <span id="chap16.xhtml#page98">finding</span> the optimal depth assuming that we have an ideal engine for turning heat into electricity, and that drilling to any depth is free.</p><p>For the temperature profile shown in figure 16.4, I calculated that the optimal depth is about 15 km. Under these conditions, an ideal heat engine would deliver 17¬†mW/m<sup>2</sup>. At the world population density of 43 people per square km, that‚Äôs 10¬†kWh per person per day, if <em>all</em> land area were used. In the UK, the population density is 5 times greater, so wide-scale geothermal power of this sustainable-forever variety could offer at most <span class="green">2¬†kWh per person per day</span>.</p><p>This is the sustainable-forever figure, ignoring hot spots, assuming perfect power stations, assuming every square metre of continent is exploited, and assuming that drilling is free. And that it is possible to drill 15-km deep holes.</p><h2 id="geothermal-power-as-mining">Geothermal power as mining</h2><p>The other geothermal strategy is to treat the heat as a resource to be mined. In &quot;enhanced geothermal extraction&quot; from hot dry rocks (figure 16.5), we first drill down to a depth of 5 or 10 km, and fracture the rocks by pumping in water. (This step may create earthquakes, which don‚Äôt go down well with the locals.) Then we drill a second well into the fracture zone. Then we pump water down one well and extract superheated water or steam from the other. This steam can be used to make electricity or to deliver heat. What‚Äôs the hot dry rock resource of the UK? Sadly, Britain is not well endowed. Most of the hot rocks are concentrated in Cornwall, where some geothermal experiments were carried out in 1985 in a research facility at Rosemanowes, now closed. Consultants assessing these experiments concluded that &quot;generation of electrical power from hot dry rock was unlikely to be technically or commercially viable in Cornwall, or elsewhere in the UK, in the short or medium term.&quot;<sup id="fnref-ch16n02"><a class="jsx-1614200154 footnote-ref" href="/sewtha#fn-ch16n02">ch16n02</a></sup> Nonetheless, what is the resource? The biggest estimate of the hot dry rock resource in the UK is a total energy of 130 000 TWh, which, according to the consultants, could conceivably contribute <span class="green">1.1¬†kWh per day per person</span> of electricity for about 800 years.<sup id="fnref-ch16n03"><a class="jsx-1614200154 footnote-ref" href="/sewtha#fn-ch16n03">ch16n03</a></sup></p><p>Other places in the world have more promising hot dry rocks,<sup id="fnref-ch16n04"><a class="jsx-1614200154 footnote-ref" href="/sewtha#fn-ch16n04">ch16n04</a></sup> so if you want to know the geothermal answers for other countries, be sure to ask a local.

That works out to about 80 TWh per year of energy going into defence: making bullets, bombs, nuclear weapons; making devices for delivering bullets, bombs, and nuclear weapons; and roaring around keeping in trim for the next game of good-against-evil.

The Institute of Electrical Engineers published a report on renewable energy in 2002 ‚Äì a summary of possible contributions from renewables in the UK. The second column of figure 18.6 shows the &quot;technical potential&quot; of a variety of renewable technologies for UK electricity generation ‚Äì &quot;an upper limit that is unlikely ever to be exceeded even with quite dramatic changes in the structure of our society and economy.&quot; According to the IEE, the total of all renewables‚Äô technical potential is about 27¬†kWh/d per person.</li><li><strong>Tyndall</strong>
The Tyndall Centre‚Äôs estimate of the total practicable renewable energy resource is 15¬†kWh per day per person.</li><li><strong>IAG</strong>
The Interdepartmental Analysts Group‚Äôs estimates of renewables, take into account economic constraints. Their total practical¬†<em>and</em>¬†economical resource (at a retail price of 7p/kWh) is 12¬†kWh per day per person.</li><li><strong>PIU</strong>
The &quot;PIU&quot; column shows the &quot;indicative resource potential for renewable electricity generation options&quot; from the DTI‚Äôs contribution to the PIU review in 2001. For each technology I show their &quot;practical maximum,&quot; or, if no practical maximum was given, their &quot;theoretical maximum.&quot;</li><li><strong>CAT</strong>

So, what are our options, if we wish to get off fossil fuels and live sustainably? We can balance the energy budget either by reducing demand, or by increasing supply, or, of course, by doing both.</p><p>Have no illusions. To achieve our goal of getting off fossil fuels, these reductions in demand and increases in supply must be <em>big</em>. Don‚Äôt be distracted by the myth that &quot;every little helps.&quot; <em>If everyone does a little, we‚Äôll achieve only a little</em>. We must do a lot. What‚Äôs required are <em>big</em> changes in demand and in supply.</p><p>&quot;But surely, if 60¬†million people all do a little, it‚Äôll add up to a lot?&quot; No. This &quot;if-everyone&quot; multiplying machine is just a way of making something small <em>sound</em> big. The &quot;if-everyone&quot; multiplying machine churns out inspirational statements of the form &quot;if <em>everyone</em> did X, then it would provide enough energy/water/gas to do Y,&quot; where Y sounds impressive. Is it surprising that Y sounds big? Of course not.

The mantra &quot;<em>Little changes can make a big difference</em>&quot; is bunkum, when applied to climate change and power. It may be true that &quot;many people doing a little adds up to a lot,&quot; if all those &quot;littles&quot; are somehow focused into a single &quot;lot&quot; ‚Äì for example, if one million people donate ¬£10 to <em>one</em> accident victim, then the victim receives ¬£10¬†million. That‚Äôs a lot. But power is a very different thing. We all use power. So to achieve a &quot;big difference&quot; in total power consumption, you need almost everyone to make a &quot;big&quot; difference to their own power consumption.</p><p>So, what‚Äôs required are <em>big</em> changes in demand and in supply. Demand for power could be reduced in three ways:</p><ol><li>by reducing our population (figure 19.2);</li><li>by changing our lifestyle;</li><li>by keeping our lifestyle, but reducing its energy intensity through &quot;efficiency&quot; and &quot;technology.&quot;</li></ol><p>Supply could be increased in three ways:</p><ol><li>We could get off fossil fuels by investing in &quot;clean coal&quot; technology. Oops<!-- -->!<!-- --> Coal is a fossil fuel. Well, never mind ‚Äì let‚Äôs take a look at this idea.

If we import renewable energy from other countries in order to avoid building renewable facilities the size of Wales in <em>our</em> country, someone will have to build facilities roughly the size of Wales in those other countries.</li></ol><p>The next seven chapters discuss first how to reduce demand substantially, and second how to increase supply to meet that reduced, but still &quot;huge,&quot; demand. In these chapters, I won‚Äôt mention <em>all</em> the good ideas.

My cartoon-Britain consumes energy in just three forms: heating, transport, and electricity. The heating consumption of cartoon-Britain is 40¬†kWh per day per person (currently all supplied by fossil fuels); the transport consumption is also 40¬†kWh per day per person (currently all supplied by fossil fuels); and the electricity consumption is 18¬†kWh(e) per day per person; the electricity is currently almost all generated from fossil fuels; the conversion of fossil-fuel energy to electricity is 40% efficient, so supplying 18¬†kWh(e) of electricity in today‚Äôs cartoon-Britain requires a fossil-fuel input of 45¬†kWh per day per person. This simplification ignores some fairly sizeable details, such as agriculture and industry, and the embodied energy of imported goods<!-- -->!<!-- --> But I‚Äôd like to be able to have a <em>quick</em> conversation about the main things we need to do to get off fossil fuels. Heating, transport, and electricity account for more than half of our energy consumption, so if we can come up with a plan that delivers heating, transport, and electricity sustainably, then we have made a good step on the way to a more detailed plan that adds up.</p><p><img src="/img/sewtha/figure133.gif"/></p><span class="figurenumber">Figure 19.3</span>.

Second, how can we reduce heating‚Äôs energy-demand and eliminate all fossil fuel use for heating? This is the topic of Chapter 21. Third, what about electricity? Chapter 22 discusses efficiency in electricity consumption.</p><p>Three supply options ‚Äì clean coal, nuclear, and other people‚Äôs renewables ‚Äì are then discussed in Chapters 23, 24, and 25. Finally, Chapter 26 discusses how to cope with fluctuations in demand and fluctuations in renewable power production.</p><p>Having laid out the demand-reducing and supply-increasing options, Chapters 27 and 28 discuss various ways to put these options together to make plans that add up, in order to supply cartoon-Britain‚Äôs transport, heating, and electricity.</p><p>I could spend many pages discussing &quot;50 things you can do to make a difference,&quot; but I think this cartoon approach, chasing the three biggest fish, should lead to more effective policies.</p><p>But what about &quot;stuff&quot;?

Here is a quick summary, a sneak preview of Part II.</p><p>First, we electrify transport. Electrification both gets transport off fossil fuels, and makes transport more energy-efficient. (Of course, electrification increases our demand for green electricity.)</p><p>Second, to supplement solar-thermal heating, we electrify most heating of air and water in buildings using <em>heat pumps</em>, which are four times more efficient than ordinary electrical heaters. This electrification of heating further increases the amount of green electricity required.</p><p>Third, we get all the green electricity from a mix of four sources: from our own renewables; perhaps from &quot;clean coal;&quot; perhaps from nuclear; and finally, and with great politeness, from other countries‚Äô renewables.</p><p>Among other countries‚Äô renewables, solar power in deserts is the most plentiful option. As long as we can build peaceful international collaborations, solar power in other people‚Äôs deserts certainly has the technical potential to provide us, them, and everyone with 125¬†kWh per day per person.</p><p>Questions?

Can <em>technology</em> deliver a reduction in consumption? In this chapter we explore options for achieving two goals: to deliver the biggest possible reduction in transport‚Äôs energy use, <em>and</em> to eliminate fossil fuel use in transport.</p><p>Transport featured in three of our consumption chapters: Chapter 3 (cars), Chapter 5 (planes), and Chapter 15 (road freight and sea freight). So there are two sorts of transport to address: passenger transport, and freight. Our unit of passenger transport is the passenger-kilometre (p-km). If a car carries one person a distance of 100 km, it delivers 100 p-km of transportation. If it carries four people the same distance, it has delivered 400 p-km. Similarly our unit of freight transport is the ton-km (t-km). If a truck carries 5 t of cargo a distance of 100 km then it has delivered 500 t-km of freight-transport. We‚Äôll measure the energy consumption of passenger transport in &quot;kWh per 100 passenger-kilometres,&quot; and the energy consumption of freight in &quot;kWh per ton-km.&quot; Notice that these measures are the other way up compared to &quot;miles per gallon&quot;: whereas we like vehicles to deliver <em>many</em> miles per gallon, we want energy-consumption to be <em>few</em> kWh per 100 p-km.</p><p><img src="/img/sewtha/figure134.gif"/></p><span class="figurenumber">Figure 20.1.</span> This chapter‚Äôs starting point: an urban luxury tractor. The average UK car has a fuel consumption of 33¬†miles per gallon, which corresponds to an energy consumption of <span class="mauve">80¬†kWh per 100 km</span>. Can we do better?<p>We‚Äôll start this chapter by discussing how to reduce the energy consumption of surface transport. To understand how to reduce energy consumption, we need to understand where the energy is going in surface transport. Here are the three key concepts, which are explained in more detail in Technical Chapter A.</p><ol><li><p>In <em>short-distance travel</em> with lots of starting and stopping, the energy mainly goes into speeding up the vehicle and its contents. Key strategies for consuming less in this sort of transportation are therefore to <em>weigh less</em>, and to <em>go further between stops</em>. Regenerative braking, which captures energy when slowing down, may help too. In addition, it helps to <em>move slower</em>, and to <em>move less</em>.</p></li><li><p>In <em>long-distance travel</em> at steady speed, by train or automobile, most of the energy goes into making air swirl around, because you only have to accelerate the vehicle once. The key strategies for consuming less in this sort of transportation are therefore to <em>move slower</em>, and to <em>move less</em>, and to <em>use long, thin vehicles</em>.</p></li><li><p>In all forms of travel, there‚Äôs an energy-conversion chain, which takes energy in some sort of fuel and uses some of it to push the vehicle forwards. Inevitably this energy chain has inefficiencies. In a standard fossil-fuel car, for example, only 25% is used for pushing, and roughly 75% of the energy is lost in making the engine and radiator hot. So a final strategy for consuming less energy is to make the energy-conversion chain more efficient.</p></li></ol><p>These observations lead us to six principles of vehicle design and vehicle use for more-efficient surface transport: <em>a)</em> reduce the frontal area per person; <em>b)</em> reduce the vehicle‚Äôs weight per person; <em>c)</em> when travelling, go at a steady speed and avoid using brakes; <em>d)</em> travel more slowly; <em>e)</em> travel less; and <em>f)</em> make the energy chain more efficient. We‚Äôll now discuss a variety of ways to apply these principles.</p><h2 id="how-to-roll-better">How to roll better</h2><p><img src="/img/sewtha/figure137.gif"/></p><span class="figurenumber">Figure 20.2.</span> Team Crocodile‚Äôs eco-car uses <span class="mauve">1.3¬†kWh per 100 km</span>.

The answer is yes, almost, but only by applying the principles of vehicle design and vehicle use, listed above, to <em>extreme</em> degrees.</p><p>One illustration of extreme vehicle design is an eco-car, which has small frontal area and low weight, and ‚Äì if any records are to be broken ‚Äì is carefully driven at a low and steady speed. The <em>Team Crocodile</em> eco-car (figure 20.2) does 2184¬†miles per gallon (1.3¬†kWh per 100 km) at a speed of 15¬†mph (24 km/h). Weighing 50 kg and shorter in height than a traffic cone, it comfortably accommodates one teenage driver.</p><p>Hmm. I think that the driver of the urban tractor in figure 20.1¬†might detect a change in &quot;look, feel and performance&quot; if we switched them to the eco-car and instructed them to keep their speed below 15¬†miles per hour. So, the idea that cars could easily be 100 times more energy efficient is a myth. We‚Äôll come back to the challenge of making energy-efficient cars in a moment. But first, let‚Äôs see some other ways of satisfying the principles of more-efficient surface transport.</p><p>Figure 20.3 shows a multi-passenger vehicle that is at least 25 times more energy-efficient than a standard petrol car: a bicycle. The bicycle‚Äôs performance (in terms of energy per distance) is about the same as the ecocar‚Äôs.<sup id="fnref-ch20n02"><a class="jsx-1614200154 footnote-ref" href="/sewtha#fn-ch20n02">ch20n02</a></sup> Its speed is the same, its mass is lower than the eco-car‚Äôs (because the human replaces the fuel tank and engine), and its effective frontal area is higher, because the cyclist is not so well streamlined as the eco-car.</p><p>Figure 20.4 shows another possible replacement for the petrol car: a train, with an energy-cost, if full, of <span class="mauve">1.6¬†kWh per 100 passenger-km</span>. In contrast to the eco-car and the bicycle, trains manage to achieve outstanding efficiency without travelling slowly, and without having a low weight per person. Trains make up for their high speed and heavy frame by exploiting the principle of small frontal area per person. Whereas a cyclist and a regular car have effective frontal areas of about 0.8¬†m<sup>2</sup> and 0.5¬†m<sup>2</sup> respectively, a full commuter train from Cambridge to London has a frontal area per passenger of 0.02¬†m<sup>2</sup>.</p><p>But whoops, now we‚Äôve broached an ugly topic ‚Äì the prospect of sharing a vehicle with &quot;all those horrible people.&quot; Well, squish aboard, and let‚Äôs ask: How much could consumption be reduced by a switch from personal gas-guzzlers to excellent integrated public transport?</p><p><img src="/img/sewtha/figure136.gif"/></p><span class="figurenumber">Figure 20.5.</span> Some public transports, and their energy-efficiencies, when on best behaviour.

The fact that people merrily <em>buy</em> from this wide range is also proof that we need extra incentives and legislation to encourage the blithe consumer to <em>choose</em> more energy-efficient cars. There are various ways to help consumers prefer the Honda Civic over the Honda NSX 3.2 gas-guzzler: raising the price of fuel; cranking up the showroom tax (the tax on new cars) in proportion to the predicted lifetime consumption of the vehicle; cranking up the road-tax on gas guzzlers; parking privileges for economical cars (figure 20.10); or fuel rationing. All such measures are unpopular with at least some voters. Perhaps a better legislative tactic would be to <em>enforce</em> reasonable energy-efficiency, rather than continuing to allow unconstrained choice; for example, we could simply <em>ban</em>, from a certain date, the sale of <em>any</em> car whose energy consumption is more than 80¬†kWh per 100 km; and then, over time, reduce this ceiling to 60¬†kWh per 100 km, then 40¬†kWh per 100 km, and beyond. Alternatively, to give the consumer more choice, regulations could force car manufacturers to reduce the <em>average</em> energy consumption of all the cars they sell. Additional legislation limiting the weight and frontal area of vehicles would simultaneously reduce fuel consumption and improve safety for other road-users (figure 20.11).

Hydrogen is a less convenient energy storage medium than most liquid fuels, because of its bulk, whether stored as a high pressure gas or as a liquid (which requires a temperature of -253 ¬∞C). Even at a pressure of 700 bar (which requires a hefty pressure vessel) its energy density (energy per unit volume) is 22% of gasoline‚Äôs. The cryogenic tank of the BMW Hydrogen 7 weighs 120 kg and stores 8 kg of hydrogen. Furthermore, hydrogen gradually leaks out of any practical container. If you park your hydrogen car at the railway station with a full tank and come back a week later, you should expect to find most of the hydrogen has gone.</p><h3 id="some-questions-about-electric-vehicles">Some questions about electric vehicles</h3><h4 id="youve-shown-that-electric-cars-are-more-energy-efficient-than-fossil-cars-but-are-they-better-if-our-objective-is-to-reduce-cosub2sub-emissions-and-the-electricity-is-still-generated-by-fossil-power-stations">You‚Äôve shown that electric cars are more energy-efficient than fossil cars. But are they better if our objective is to reduce CO<sub>2</sub> emissions, and the electricity is still generated by fossil power stations?</h4><p>This is quite an easy calculation to do. Assume the electric vehicle‚Äôs energy cost is 20¬†kWh(e) per 100 km. (I think 15¬†kWh(e) per 100 km is perfectly possible, but let‚Äôs play sceptical in this calculation.) If grid electricity has a carbon footprint of 500 g per kWh(e) then the effective emissions of this vehicle are <strong>100 g CO<sub>2</sub> per km</strong>, which is as good as the best fossil cars (figure 20.9). So I conclude that switching to electric cars is <em>already</em> a good idea, even before we green our electricity supply.</p><h4 id="electric-cars-like-fossil-cars-have-costs-of-both-manufacture-and-use-electric-cars-may-cost-less-to-use-but-if-the-batteries-dont-last-very-long-shouldnt-you-pay-more-attention-to-the-manufacturing-cost">Electric cars, like fossil cars, have costs of both manufacture and use. Electric cars may cost less to use, but if the batteries don‚Äôt last very long, shouldn‚Äôt you pay more attention to the manufacturing cost?</h4><p>Yes, that‚Äôs a good point. My transport diagram shows only the use cost. If electric cars require new batteries every few years, my numbers may be underestimates. The batteries in a Prius are expected to last just 10 years, and a new set would cost ¬£3500. Will anyone want to own a 10-year old Prius and pay that cost? It could be predicted that most Priuses will be junked at age 10 years. This is certainly a concern for all electric vehicles that have batteries. I guess I‚Äôm optimistic that, as we switch to electric vehicles, battery technology is going to improve.</p><h4 id="i-live-in-a-hot-place-how-could-i-drive-an-electric-car-i-demand-power-hungry-air-conditioning">I live in a hot place. How could I drive an electric car? I demand power-hungry air-conditioning<!-- -->!</h4><p>There‚Äôs an elegant fix for this demand: fit 4¬†m<sup>2</sup> of photovoltaic panels in the upward-facing surfaces of the electric car. If the air-conditioning is needed, the sun must surely be shining. 20%-efficient panels will generate up to 800 W, which is enough to power a car‚Äôs air-conditioning. The panels might even make a useful contribution to charging the car when it‚Äôs parked, too. Solar-powered vehicle cooling was included in a Mazda in 1993; the solar cells were embedded in the glass sunroof.</p><h4 id="i-live-in-a-cold-place-how-could-i-drive-an-electric-car-i-demand-power-hungry-heating">I live in a cold place. How could I drive an electric car? I demand power-hungry heating<!-- -->!</h4><p>The motor of an electric vehicle, when it‚Äôs running, will on average use something like 10¬†kW, with an efficiency of 90‚Äì95%. Some of the lost power, the other 5‚Äì10%, will be dissipated as heat in the motor. Perhaps electric cars that are going to be used in cold places can be carefully designed so that this motor-generated heat, which might amount to 250 or 500 W, can be piped from the motor into the car. That much power would provide some significant windscreen demisting or body-warming.</p><h4 id="are-lithium-ion-batteries-safe-in-an-accident">Are lithium-ion batteries safe in an accident?</h4><p>Some lithium-ion batteries are unsafe when short-circuited or overheated, but the battery industry is now producing safer batteries such as lithium phosphate.

That‚Äôs more than the number of cars in the world today (roughly 1 billion) ‚Äì but not much more, so the amount of lithium may be a concern, especially when we take into account the competing ambitions of the nuclear fusion posse (Chapter 24) to guzzle lithium in their reactors.

Photo by Wofratz.<p>For a time, I thought that the way to solve the long-distance-transport problem was to revert to the way it was done before planes: ocean liners. Then I looked at the numbers. The sad truth is that ocean liners use more energy per passenger-km than jumbo jets. The QE2 uses four times as much energy per passenger-km as a jumbo. OK, it‚Äôs a luxury vessel; can we do better with slower tourist-class liners? From 1952 to 1968, the economical way to cross the Atlantic was in two Dutch-built liners known as &quot;The Economy Twins,&quot; the Maasdam and the Rijndam.<sup id="fnref-ch20n23"><a class="jsx-1614200154 footnote-ref" href="/sewtha#fn-ch20n23">ch20n23</a></sup> These travelled at 16.5 knots (30.5 km/h), so the crossing from Britain to New York took eight days. Their energy consumption, if they carried a full load of 893 passengers, was 103¬†kWh per 100 p-km. At a typical 85% occupancy, the energy consumption was <span class="mauve">121¬†kWh per 100 pkm</span> ‚Äì more than twice that of the jumbo jet. To be fair to the boats, they are not only providing transportation: they also provide the passengers and crew with hot air, hot water, light, and entertainment for several days; but the energy saved back home from being cooped up on the boat is dwarfed by the boat‚Äôs energy consumption, which, in the case of the QE2, is about 3000¬†kWh per day per passenger.</p><p>So, sadly, I don‚Äôt think boats are going to beat planes in energy consumption. If eventually we want a way of travelling large distances without fossil fuels, perhaps nuclear-powered ships are an interesting option (figures 20.31 &amp; 20.32).</p><h2 id="what-about-freight">What about freight?</h2><p>International shipping is a surprisingly efficient user of fossil fuels; so getting road transport off fossil fuels is a higher priority than getting ships off fossil fuels. But fossil fuels are a finite resource, and eventually ships must be powered by something else. Biofuels <em>may</em> work out. Another option will be nuclear power. The first nuclear-powered ship for carrying cargo and passengers was the NS Savannah, launched in 1962 as part of President Dwight D. Eisenhower‚Äôs <em>Atoms for Peace</em> initiative (figure 20.31). Powered by one 74-MW nuclear reactor driving a 15-MW motor, the Savannah had a service speed of 21 knots (39 km/h) and could carry 60 passengers and 14000 t of cargo. That‚Äôs a cargo transport cost of 0.14¬†kWh per ton-km. She could travel 500 000 km without refuelling. There are already many nuclear-powered ships, both military and civilian. Russia has ten nuclear-powered ice-breakers, for example, of which seven are still active.

How about heating? What sort of energy-savings can technology or lifestyle-change offer?</p><p>The power used to heat a building is given by multiplying together three quantities:</p><p>[<!-- -->\begin{matrix}

{= \frac{\text{average\ temperature\ difference~} \times \text{~leakiness\ of\ building}}{\text{efficiency\ of\ heating\ system}}} <!-- -->\<!-- -->
\end{matrix}<!-- -->]</p><p>Let me explain this formula (which is discussed in detail in Chapter E) with an example. My house is a three-bedroom semi-detached house built about 1940 (figure 21.1). The <span class="mauve">average temperature difference</span> between the inside and outside of the house depends on the setting of the thermostat and on the weather. If the thermostat is permanently at 20¬†¬∞C, the average temperature difference might be <span class="mauve">9¬†¬∞C</span>. The <span class="darkblue"><em>leakiness</em> of the building</span> describes how quickly heat gets out through walls, windows, and cracks, in response to a temperature difference. The leakiness is sometimes called the <em>heat-loss coefficient</em> of the building. It is measured in kWh per day per degree of temperature difference. In Chapter E, I calculate that the leakiness of my house in 2006 was 7.7¬†kWh/d/¬∞C. The product</p><span class="mauve">average temperature difference</span> √ó <span class="darkblue">leakiness of building</span><p>is the rate at which heat flows out of the house by conduction and ventilation. For example, if the average temperature difference is <span class="mauve">9¬†¬∞C</span> then the heat loss is</p><span class="mauve">9¬†¬∞C</span> √ó <span class="darkblue">7.7¬†kWh/d/¬∞C</span>¬†‚âÖ¬†70¬†kWh/d.<p>Finally, to calculate the power required, we divide this heat loss by the efficiency of the heating system. In my house, the condensing gas boiler has an efficiency of <span class="green">90%</span>, so we find:</p><p>[<!-- -->\text{power\ used~} = \ \frac{\text{9~¬∞C~} \times \text{~7.7\ kWh/d/¬∞C}}{\text{0.9}}\  = \text{~77\ kWh/d}\text{.}<!-- -->]</p><p>That‚Äôs bigger than the space-heating requirement we estimated in Chapter 7. It‚Äôs bigger for two reasons: first, this formula assumes that all the heat is supplied by the boiler, whereas in fact some heat is supplied by incidental heat gains from occupants, gadgets, and the sun; second, in Chapter 7 we assumed that a person kept just two rooms at 20¬†¬∞C all the time; keeping an entire house at this temperature all the time would require more.</p><p>OK, how can we reduce the power used by heating? Well, obviously, there are three lines of attack.</p><ol><li>Reduce the <span class="mauve">average temperature difference</span>. This can be achieved by turning thermostats down (or, if you have friends in high places, by changing the weather).</li><li>Reduce the <span class="darkblue">leakiness of the building</span>. This can be done by improving the building‚Äôs insulation ‚Äì think triple glazing, draught-proofing, and fluffy blankets in the loft ‚Äì or, more radically, by demolishing the building and replacing it with a better insulated building; or perhaps by living in a building of smaller size per person.

Some humans call turning the thermostat down a lifestyle change, and are not happy with it. I‚Äôll make some suggestions later about how to sidestep this lifestyle issue.

Let‚Äôs pick up the story. In 2004 I had a condensing boiler installed, replacing the old gas boiler. (Condensing boilers use a heat-exchanger to transfer heat from the exhaust gases to incoming air.) At the same time I removed the house‚Äôs hot-water tank (so hot water is now made only on demand), and I put thermostats on all the bedroom radiators. Along with the new condensing boiler came a new heating controller that allows me to set different target temperatures for different times of day. With these changes, my consumption decreased from an average of 50¬†kWh/d to about 32¬†kWh/d.</p><p><img src="/img/sewtha/figure177.gif"/></p><span class="figurenumber">Figure 21.4</span>.

Evidently, the more frequently I read my meter, the less gas I use\!<p><img src="/img/sewtha/figure178.gif"/></p><span class="figurenumber">Figure 21.5</span>. Cavity-wall insulation going in.<p>This reduction from 50 to 32¬†kWh/d is quite satisfying, but it‚Äôs not enough, if the aim is to reduce one‚Äôs fossil fuel footprint below one ton of CO<sub>2</sub> per year. 32¬†kWh/d of gas corresponds to over 2 tons CO<sub>2</sub> per year.</p><p>In 2007, I started paying more careful attention to my energy meters. I had cavity-wall insulation installed (figure 21.5) and improved my loft insulation. I replaced the single-glazed back door by a double-glazed door, and added an extra double-glazed door to the front porch (figure 21.6). Most important of all, I paid more attention to my thermostat settings. This attentiveness has led to a further halving in gas consumption.

A new front door.<p>So, my main tip is cunning thermostat management. What‚Äôs a reasonable thermostat setting to aim for? Nowadays many people seem to think that 17¬†¬∞C is unbearably cold. However, the average winter-time temperature in British houses in 1970 was 13¬†¬∞C<!-- -->!<sup id="fnref-ch21n02"><a class="jsx-1614200154 footnote-ref" href="/sewtha#fn-ch21n02">ch21n02</a></sup> A human‚Äôs perception of whether they feel warm depends on what they are doing, and what they‚Äôve been doing for the last hour or so. My suggestion is, <em>don‚Äôt think in terms of a thermostat setting</em>. Rather than fixing the thermostat to a single value, try just leaving it at a really low value most of the time (say 13 or 15¬†¬∞C), and turn it up temporarily whenever you feel cold. It‚Äôs like the lights in a library. If you allow yourself to ask the question &quot;what is the right light level in the bookshelves?&quot; then you‚Äôll no doubt answer &quot;bright enough to read the book titles,&quot; and you‚Äôll have bright lights on all the time. But that question presumes that we have to fix the light level; and we don‚Äôt have to. We can fit light switches that the reader can turn on, and that switch themselves off again after an appropriate time. Similarly, thermostats don‚Äôt need to be left up at 20¬∞C all the time.</p><p>Before leaving the topic of thermostat settings, I should mention airconditioning. Doesn‚Äôt it drive you crazy to go into a building in summer where the thermostat of the air-conditioning is set to 18¬†¬∞C? These loony building managers are subjecting everyone to temperatures that in wintertime they would whinge are too cold<!-- -->!<!-- --> In Japan, the government‚Äôs &quot;CoolBiz&quot; guidelines recommend that air-conditioning be set to 28¬†¬∞C (82¬†¬∞F).</p><h2 id="better-buildings">Better buildings</h2><p>If you get the chance to build a new building then there are lots of ways to ensure its heating consumption is much smaller than that of an old building. Figure 21.2 gave evidence that modern houses are built to much better insulation standards than those of the 1940s. But the building standards in Britain could be still better, as Chapter E discusses. The three key ideas for the best results are: (1) have really thick insulation in floors, walls, and roofs; (2) ensure the building is completely sealed and use active ventilation to introduce fresh air and remove stale and humid air, with heat exchangers passively recovering much of the heat from the removed air; (3) design the building to exploit sunshine as much as possible.</p><h2 id="the-energy-cost-of-heat">The energy cost of heat</h2><p>So far, this chapter has focused on temperature control and leakiness. Now we turn to the third factor in the equation:</p><p>[<!-- -->\begin{matrix}

{= \frac{\text{average\ temperature\ difference~} \times \text{~leakiness\ of\ building}}{\text{efficiency\ of\ heating\ system}}} <!-- -->\<!-- -->
\end{matrix}<!-- -->]</p><p>How efficiently can heat be produced? Can we obtain heat on the cheap? Today, building-heating in Britain is primarily delivered by burning a fossil fuel, natural gas, in boilers with efficiencies of 78%‚Äì90%. Can we get off fossil fuels at the same time as making building-heating more efficient?</p><p>One technology that is held up as an answer to Britain‚Äôs heating problem is called &quot;combined heat and power&quot; (CHP), or its cousin, &quot;microCHP.&quot; I will explain combined heat and power now, but I‚Äôve come to the conclusion that it‚Äôs a bad idea, because there‚Äôs a better technology for heating, called heat pumps, which I‚Äôll describe in a few pages.</p><p><img src="/img/sewtha/figure184.gif"/></p><span class="figurenumber">Figure 21.7</span>. Eggborough. Not a power station participating in smart heating.<p><img src="/img/sewtha/figure180.gif"/></p><span class="figurenumber">Figure 21.8</span>. How a power station works. There has to be a cold place to condense the steam to make the turbine go round. The cold place is usually a cooling tower or river.<h3 id="combined-heat-and-power">Combined heat and power</h3><p>The standard view of conventional big centralised power stations is that they are terribly inefficient, chucking heat willy-nilly up chimneys and cooling towers. A more sophisticated view recognizes that to turn thermal energy into electricity, we inevitably have to dump heat in a cold place (figure 21.8). That is how heat engines work. There <em>has</em> to be a cold place. But surely, it‚Äôs argued, we could use <em>buildings</em> as the dumping place for this &quot;waste&quot; heat instead of cooling towers or sea water? This idea is called &quot;combined heat and power&quot; (CHP) or cogeneration, and it‚Äôs been widely used in continental Europe for decades ‚Äì in many cities, a big power station is integrated with a district heating system. Proponents of the modern incarnation of combined heat and power, &quot;micro-CHP,&quot; suggest that tiny power stations should be created within single buildings or small collections of buildings, delivering heat and electricity to those buildings, and exporting some electricity to the grid.</p><p><img src="/img/sewtha/figure181.gif"/></p><span class="figurenumber">Figure 21.9</span>. Combined heat and power. District heating absorbs heat that would have been chucked up a cooling tower.<p>There‚Äôs certainly some truth in the view that Britain is rather backward when it comes to district heating and combined heat and power,<sup id="fnref-ch21n03"><a class="jsx-1614200154 footnote-ref" href="/sewtha#fn-ch21n03">ch21n03</a></sup> but discussion is hampered by a general lack of numbers, and by two particular errors. First, when comparing different ways of using fuel, the wrong measure of &quot;efficiency&quot; is used, namely one that weights electricity as having equal value to heat. The truth is, electricity is more valuable than heat. Second, it‚Äôs widely assumed that the &quot;waste&quot; heat in a traditional power station could be captured for a useful purpose <em>without impairing the power station‚Äôs electricity production</em>. This sadly is not true, as the numbers will show. Delivering useful heat to a customer always reduces the electricity produced to some degree. The true net gains from combined heat and power are often much smaller than the hype would lead you to believe.</p><p>A final impediment to rational discussion of combined heat and power is a myth that has grown up recently, that decentralizing a technology somehow makes it greener. So whereas big centralized fossil fuel power stations are &quot;bad,&quot; flocks of local micro-power stations are imbued with goodness. But if decentralization is actually a good idea then &quot;small is beautiful&quot; should be evident in the numbers. Decentralization should be able to stand on its own two feet. And what the numbers actually show is that <em>centralized</em> electricity generation has many benefits in both economic and energy terms. Only in large buildings is there any benefit to local generation, and usually that benefit is only about 10% or 20%.</p><p>The government has a target for growth of combined heat and power to 10 GW of electrical capacity by 2010, but I think that growth of gas-powered combined heat and power would be a mistake. Such combined heat and power is not green: it uses fossil fuel, and it locks us into continued use of fossil fuel. Given that heat pumps are a better technology, I believe we should leapfrog over gas-powered combined heat and power and go directly for heat pumps.</p><h3 id="heat-pumps">Heat pumps</h3><p>Like district heating and combined heat and power, heat pumps are already widely used in continental Europe, but strangely rare in Britain. Heat pumps are back-to-front refrigerators. Feel the back of your refrigerator: it‚Äôs <em>warm</em>. A refrigerator moves heat from one place (its inside) to another (its back panel). So one way to heat a building is to turn a refrigerator inside-out ‚Äì put the <em>inside</em> of the refrigerator in the garden, thus cooling the garden down; and leave the back panel of the refrigerator in your kitchen, thus warming the house up. What isn‚Äôt obvious about this whacky idea is that it is a really efficient way to warm your house. For every kilowatt of power drawn from the electricity grid, the back-to-front refrigerator can pump three kilowatts of heat from the garden, so that a total of four kilowatts of heat gets into your house. So heat pumps are roughly four times as efficient as a standard electrical bar-fire.<sup id="fnref-ch21n04"><a class="jsx-1614200154 footnote-ref" href="/sewtha#fn-ch21n04">ch21n04</a></sup> Whereas the bar-fire‚Äôs efficiency is 100%, the heat pump‚Äôs is 400%. The efficiency of a heat pump is usually called its <em>coefficient of performance</em> or CoP. If the efficiency is 400%, the coefficient of performance is 4.</p><p><img src="/img/sewtha/figure182.gif"/></p><span class="figurenumber">Figure 21.10</span>. Heat pumps.<p><img src="/img/sewtha/figure185.gif"/></p><span class="figurenumber">Figure 21.11</span>. The inner and outer bits of an air-source heat pump that has a coefficient of performance of 4. The inner bit is accompanied by a ball-point pen, for scale. One of these Fujitsu units can deliver 3.6¬†kW of heating when using just 0.845¬†kW of electricity. It can also run in reverse, delivering 2.6¬†kW of cooling when using 0.655¬†kW of electricity.<p>Heat pumps can be configured in various ways (figure 21.10). A heat pump can cool down the <em>air</em> in your garden using a heat-exchanger (typically a 1-metre tall white box, figure 21.11), in which case it‚Äôs called an air-source heat pump. Alternatively, the pump may cool down the <em>ground</em> using big loops of underground plumbing (many tens of metres long), in which case it‚Äôs called a ground-source heat pump. Heat can also be pumped from rivers and lakes.</p><p>Some heat pumps can pump heat in either direction. When an airsource heat pump runs in reverse, it uses electricity to warm up the <em>outside</em> air and cool down the air <em>inside</em> your building. This is called air-conditioning. Many air-conditioners are indeed heat-pumps working in precisely this way. Ground-source heat pumps can also work as air-conditioners. So a single piece of hardware can be used to provide winter heating and summer cooling.</p><p>People sometimes say that ground-source heat pumps use &quot;geothermal energy,&quot; but that‚Äôs not the right name. As we saw in Chapter 16, geothermal energy offers only a tiny trickle of power per unit area (about 50¬†mW/m<sup>2</sup>), in most parts of the world; heat pumps have nothing to do with this trickle, and they can be used both for heating and for cooling. Heat pumps simply use the ground as a place to suck heat from, or to dump heat into. When they steadily suck heat, that heat is actually being replenished by warmth from the sun.</p><p>There‚Äôs two things left to do in this chapter. We need to compare heat pumps with combined heat and power. Then we need to discuss what are the limits to ground-source heat pumps.</p><h3 id="heat-pumps-compared-with-combined-heat-and-power">Heat pumps, compared with combined heat and power</h3><p>I used to think that combined heat and power was a no-brainer. &quot;Obviously, we should use the discarded heat from power stations to heat buildings rather than just chucking it up a cooling tower<!-- -->!<!-- -->&quot; However, looking carefully at the numbers describing the performance of real CHP systems, I‚Äôve come to the conclusion that there are better ways of providing electricity and building-heating.</p><p>I‚Äôm going to build up a diagram in three steps.

Thus the new standard solution can deliver any electrical efficiency and heat efficiency on the line A‚ÄìB by making the electricity and heat using two separate pieces of hardware.</p><p>To give historical perspective, the diagram also shows the old standard heating solution (an ordinary non-condensing boiler, with an efficiency of 79%) and the standard way of making electricity a few decades ago (a coal power station with an electrical efficiency of 37% or so).</p><h3 id="combined-heat-and-power-1">Combined heat and power</h3><p>Next we add combined heat and power systems to the diagram. These simultaneously deliver, from chemical energy, both electricity and heat.</p><p><img src="/img/sewtha/figure329.gif"/></p><p>Each of the filled dots shows actual average performances of CHP systems in the UK, grouped by type. The hollow dots marked &quot;CT&quot; show the performances of ideal CHP systems quoted by the Carbon Trust; the hollow dots marked &quot;Nimbus&quot; are from a manufacturer‚Äôs product specifications. The dots marked &quot;ct&quot; are the performances quoted by the Carbon Trust for two real systems (at Freeman Hospital and Elizabeth House).</p><p>The main thing to notice in this diagram is that the electrical efficiencies of the CHP systems are significantly smaller than the 49% efficiency delivered by single-minded electricity-only gas power stations. So the heat is not a &quot;free by-product.&quot; Increasing the heat production hurts the electricity production.</p><p>It‚Äôs common practice to lump together the two numbers (the efficiency of electricity production and heat production) into a single &quot;total efficiency&quot; ‚Äì for example, the back pressure steam turbines delivering 10% electricity and 66% heat would be called &quot;76% efficient,&quot; but I think this is a misleading summary of performance. After all, by this measure, the 90%-efficient condensing boiler is &quot;more efficient&quot; than all the CHP systems<!-- -->!<!-- --> The fact is, electrical energy is more valuable than heat.</p><p>Many of the CHP points in this figure are superior to the &quot;old standard way of doing things&quot; (getting electricity from coal and heat from standard boilers). And the ideal CHP systems are slightly superior to the &quot;new standard way of doing things&quot; (getting electricity from gas and heat from condensing boilers). But we must bear in mind that this slight superiority comes with some drawbacks ‚Äì a CHP system delivers heat only to the places it‚Äôs connected to, whereas condensing boilers can be planted anywhere with a gas main; and compared to the standard way of doing things, CHP systems are not so flexible in the mix of electricity and heat they deliver; a CHP system will work best only when delivering a particular mix; this inflexibility leads to inefficiencies at times when, for example, excess heat is produced; in a typical house, much of the electricity demand comes in relatively brief spikes, bearing little relation to heating demand. A final problem with some micro-CHP systems is that when they have excess electricity to share, they may do a poor job of delivering power to the network.</p><p>Finally we add in heat pumps, which use electricity from the grid to pump ambient heat into buildings.</p><p><img src="/img/sewtha/figure330.gif"/></p><p>The steep green lines show the combinations of electricity and heat that you can obtain assuming that heat pumps have a coefficient of performance of 3 or 4, assuming that the extra electricity for the heat pumps is generated by an average gas power station or by a top-of-the-line gas power station, and allowing for 8% loss in the national electricity network between the power station and the building where the heat pumps pump heat. The top-of-the-line gas power station‚Äôs efficiency is 53%, assuming it‚Äôs running optimally. (I imagine the Carbon Trust and Nimbus made a similar assumption when providing the numbers used in this diagram for CHP systems.) In the future, heat pumps will probably get even better than I assumed here. In Japan, thanks to strong legislation favouring efficiency improvements, heat pumps are now available with a coefficient of performance of 4.9.</p><p>Notice that heat pumps offer a system that can be &quot;better than 100%-efficient.&quot; For example the &quot;best gas&quot; power station, feeding electricity to heat pumps can deliver a combination of 30%-efficient electricity and 80%-efficient heat, a &quot;total efficiency&quot; of 110%. No plain CHP system could ever match this performance.</p><p>Let me spell this out. Heat pumps are superior in efficiency to condensing boilers, even if the heat pumps are powered by electricity from a power station burning natural gas. If you want to heat lots of buildings using natural gas, you could install condensing boilers, which are &quot;90% efficient,&quot; or you could send the same gas to a new gas power station making electricity and install electricity-powered heat pumps in all the buildings; the second solution‚Äôs efficiency would be somewhere between 140% and 185%. It‚Äôs not necessary to dig big holes in the garden and install underfloor heating to get the benefits of heat pumps; the best air-source heat pumps (which require just a small external box, like an air-conditioner‚Äôs) can deliver hot water to normal radiators with a coefficient of performance above 3. The air-source heat pump in figure 21.11 directly delivers warm air to an office.</p><p>I thus conclude that combined heat and power, even though it sounds a good idea, is probably not the best way to heat buildings and make electricity using natural gas, assuming that air-source or ground-source heat pumps can be installed in the buildings. The heat-pump solution has further advantages that should be emphasized: heat pumps can be located in any buildings where there is an electricity supply; they can be driven by any electricity source, so they keep on working when the gas runs out or the gas price goes through the roof; and heat pumps are flexible: they can be turned on and off to suit the demand of the building occupants.</p><p>I emphasize that this critical comparison does not mean that CHP is always a bad idea. What I‚Äôm comparing here are methods for heating ordinary buildings, which requires only very low-grade heat. CHP can also be used to deliver higher-grade heat to industrial users (at 200¬†¬∞C, for example). In such industrial settings, heat pumps are unlikely to compete so well because their coefficient of performance would be lower.</p><h3 id="limits-to-growth-of-heat-pumps">Limits to growth (of heat pumps)</h3><p>Because the temperature of the ground, a few metres down, stays sluggishly close to 11¬†¬∞C, whether it‚Äôs summer or winter, the ground is theoretically a better place for a heat pump to grab its heat than the air, which in midwinter may be 10 or 15¬†¬∞C colder than the ground. So heat-pump advisors encourage the choice of ground-source over air-source heat pumps, where possible. (Heat pumps work less efficiently when there‚Äôs a big temperature difference between the inside and outside.)</p><p><img src="/img/sewtha/figure183.gif"/></p><span class="figurenumber">Figure 21.12</span>. How close together can ground-source heat pumps be packed?<p>However, the ground is not a limitless source of heat. The heat has to come from somewhere, and ground is not a very good thermal conductor. If we suck heat too fast from the ground, the ground will become as cold as ice, and the advantage of the ground-source heat pump will be diminished.</p><p>In Britain, the main purpose of heat pumps would be to get heat into buildings in the winter. The ultimate source of this heat is the sun, which replenishes heat in the ground by direct radiation and by conduction through the air. The rate at which heat is sucked from the ground must satisfy two constraints: it must not cause the ground‚Äôs temperature to drop too low during the winter; and the heat sucked in the winter must be replenished somehow during the summer. If there‚Äôs any risk that the <em>natural</em> trickling of heat in the summer won‚Äôt make up for the heat removed in the winter, then the replenishment must be driven <em>actively</em> ‚Äì for example by running the system in reverse in summer, putting heat down into the ground (and thus providing air-conditioning up top).</p><table><tr class="lineabove2 linebelow2"><th class="tcell1 center" colspan="2"><p>area per person (m<sup>2</sup>)</p></th></tr><tr><td class="tcell1"><p>Bangalore</p></td><td class="tcell1 right"><p>37</p></td></tr><tr><td class="tcell1"><p>Manhattan</p></td><td class="tcell1 right"><p>39</p></td></tr><tr><td class="tcell1"><p>Paris</p></td><td class="tcell1 right"><p>40</p></td></tr><tr><td class="tcell1"><p>Chelsea</p></td><td class="tcell1 right"><p>66</p></td></tr><tr><td class="tcell1"><p>Tokyo</p></td><td class="tcell1 right"><p>72</p></td></tr><tr><td class="tcell1"><p>Moscow</p></td><td class="tcell1 right"><p>97</p></td></tr><tr><td class="tcell1"><p>Taipei</p></td><td class="tcell1 right"><p>104</p></td></tr><tr><td class="tcell1"><p>The Hague</p></td><td class="tcell1 right"><p>152</p></td></tr><tr><td class="tcell1"><p>San Francisco</p></td><td class="tcell1 right"><p>156</p></td></tr><tr><td class="tcell1"><p>Singapore</p></td><td class="tcell1 right"><p>156</p></td></tr><tr><td class="tcell1"><p>Cambridge MA</p></td><td class="tcell1 right"><p>164</p></td></tr><tr><td class="tcell1"><p>Sydney</p></td><td class="tcell1 right"><p>174</p></td></tr><tr class="linebelow2"><td class="tcell1"><p>Portsmouth</p></td><td class="tcell1 right"><p>213</p></td></tr></table><span class="figurenumber">Table 21.13</span>. Some urban areas per person.<p>Let‚Äôs put some numbers into this discussion. How big a piece of ground does a ground-source heat pump need? Assume that we have a neighbourhood with quite a high population density ‚Äì say 6200 people per km<sup>2</sup> (160¬†m<sup>2</sup> per person), the density of a typical British suburb. Can <em>everyone</em> use ground-source heat pumps, without using active summer replenishment? A calculation in Chapter E (p303) gives a tentative answer of <em>no</em>: if we wanted everyone in the neighbourhood to be able to pull from the ground a heat flow of about 48¬†kWh/d per person (my estimate of our typical winter heat demand), we‚Äôd end up freezing the ground in the winter. Avoiding unreasonable cooling of the ground requires that the sucking rate be less than 12¬†kWh/d per person. So if we switch to ground-source heat pumps, we should plan to include substantial summer heat-dumping in the design, so as to refill the ground with heat for use in the winter. This summer heat-dumping could use heat from air-conditioning, or heat from roof-mounted solar water-heating panels. (Summer solar heat is stored in the ground for subsequent use in winter by Drake Landing Solar Community in Canada <!-- -->[<a class="jsx-1614200154 " href="http://www.dlsc.ca/"><span class="websitetitle">www.dlsc.ca</span></a>]<!-- -->.) Alternatively, we should expect to need to use some air-source heat pumps too, and then we‚Äôll be able to get all the heat we want ‚Äì as long as we have the electricity to pump it. In the UK, air temperatures don‚Äôt go very far below freezing, so concerns about poor winter-time performance of air-source pumps, which might apply in North America and Scandinavia, probably do not apply in Britain.</p><p><img src="/img/sewtha/figure331.gif"/></p><p>My conclusion: can we reduce the energy we consume for heating? Yes. Can we get off fossil fuels at the same time? Yes. Not forgetting the low-hanging fruit ‚Äì building-insulation and thermostat shenanigans ‚Äì we should replace all our fossil-fuel heaters with electric-powered heat pumps; we can reduce the energy required to 25% of today‚Äôs levels. Of course this plan for electrification would require more electricity. But even if the extra electricity came from gas-fired power stations, that would still be a much better way to get heating than what we do today, simply setting fire to the gas. Heat pumps are future-proof, allowing us to heat buildings efficiently with electricity from any source.</p><p>Nay-sayers object that the coefficient of performance of air-source heat pumps is lousy ‚Äì just 2 or 3. But their information is out of date. If we are careful to buy top-of-the-line heat pumps, we can do much better. The Japanese government legislated a decade-long efficiency drive that has greatly improved the performance of air-conditioners; thanks to this drive, there are now air-source heat pumps with a coefficient of performance of 4.9; these heat pumps can make hot water as well as hot air.<sup id="fnref-ch21n05"><a class="jsx-1614200154 footnote-ref" href="/sewtha#fn-ch21n05">ch21n05</a></sup></p><p>Another objection to heat pumps is &quot;oh, we can‚Äôt approve of people fitting efficient air-source heaters, because they might use them for air-conditioning in the summer.&quot; Come on ‚Äì I hate gratuitous air-conditioning as much as anyone, but these heat pumps are four times more efficient than any other winter heating method<!-- -->!<!-- --> Show me a better choice.

There‚Äôs a similar accounting problem with natural gas: if, say, 5% of the natural gas leaks out along the journey from hole in the ground to power station, then this accidental methane pollution is equivalent (in greenhouse effect) to a 40% boost in the carbon dioxide released at the power station.<sup id="fnref-ch23n06"><a class="jsx-1614200154 footnote-ref" href="/sewtha#fn-ch23n06">ch23n06</a></sup></p><h2 id="new-coal-technologies">New coal technologies</h2><p>Stanford-based company <a class="jsx-1614200154 " href="http://www.directcarbon.com/"><span class="websitetitle">www.directcarbon.com</span></a> are developing the <em>Direct Carbon Fuel Cell</em>, which converts fuel and air directly to electricity and CO<sub>2</sub>, without involving any water or steam turbines.

People were discussing how long British coal would last. They tended to answer this question by dividing the estimated coal remaining by the rate of coal consumption, getting answers like &quot;1000 years.&quot; But, Jevons said, consumption is <em>not</em> constant. It‚Äôs been doubling every 20 years, and &quot;progress&quot; would have it continue to do so. So &quot;reserves divided by consumption-rate&quot; gives the wrong answer.</p><p>Instead, Jevons extrapolated the exponentially-growing consumption, calculating the time by which the total amount consumed would exceed the estimated reserves. This was a much shorter time. Jevons was not assuming that consumption would actually continue to grow at the same rate; rather he was making the point that growth was not sustainable. His calculation estimated for his British readership the inevitable limits to their growth, and the short time remaining before those limits would become evident. Jevons made the bold prediction that the end of British &quot;progress&quot; would come within 100 years of 1865. Jevons was right. British coal production peaked in 1910, and by 1965 Britain was no longer a world superpower.</p><p>Let‚Äôs repeat his calculation for the world as a whole. In 2006, the coal consumption rate was 6.3 Gt per year. Comparing this with reserves of 1600 Gt of coal, people often say &quot;there‚Äôs 250 years of coal left.&quot; But if we assume &quot;business as usual&quot; implies a growing consumption, we get a different answer. If the growth rate of coal consumption were to continue at 2% per year (which gives a reasonable fit to the data from 1930 to 2000), then all the coal would be gone in 2096. If the growth rate is 3.4% per year (the growth rate over the last decade), the end of business-as-usual is coming before 2072.

That means that every single day, an amount of fossil fuels with the same weight as 28 pints of milk is extracted from a hole in the ground, transported, processed, and burned somewhere on your behalf. The average Brit‚Äôs fossil fuel habit creates 11 tons per year of waste carbon dioxide; that‚Äôs 30 kg per day. In the previous chapter we raised the idea of capturing waste carbon dioxide, compressing it into solid or liquid form, and transporting it somewhere for disposal. Imagine that one person was responsible for capturing and dealing with all their own carbon dioxide waste. 30 kg per day of carbon dioxide is a substantial rucksack-full every day ‚Äì the same weight as 53 pints of milk<!-- -->!</p><p>In contrast, the amount of natural uranium required to provide the same amount of energy as 16 kg of fossil fuels, in a standard fission reactor, is 2 grams; and the resulting waste weighs one quarter of a gram. (This 2 g of uranium is not as small as one millionth of 16 kg per day, by the way, because today‚Äôs reactors burn up less than 1% of the uranium.) To deliver 2 grams of uranium per day, the miners at the uranium mine would have to deal with perhaps 200 g of ore per day.</p><p>So the material streams flowing into and out of nuclear reactors are small, relative to fossil-fuel streams. &quot;Small is beautiful,&quot; but the fact that the nuclear waste stream is small doesn‚Äôt mean that it‚Äôs not a problem; it‚Äôs just a &quot;beautifully small&quot; problem.</p><h2 id="sustainable-power-from-nuclear-fission">&quot;Sustainable&quot; power from nuclear fission</h2><p>Figure 24.1 shows how much electricity was generated globally by nuclear power in 2007, broken down by country.</p><table><tr class="lineabove2 linebelow2"><th class="tcell1 right" colspan="2"><p>million tons uranium</p></th></tr><tr><td class="tcell1"><p>Australia</p></td><td class="tcell1 right"><p>1.14</p></td></tr><tr><td class="tcell1"><p>Kazakhstan</p></td><td class="tcell1 right"><p>0.82</p></td></tr><tr><td class="tcell1"><p>Canada</p></td><td class="tcell1 right"><p>0.44</p></td></tr><tr><td class="tcell1"><p>USA</p></td><td class="tcell1 right"><p>0.34</p></td></tr><tr><td class="tcell1"><p>South Africa</p></td><td class="tcell1 right"><p>0.34</p></td></tr><tr><td class="tcell1"><p>Namibia</p></td><td class="tcell1 right"><p>0.28</p></td></tr><tr><td class="tcell1"><p>Brazil</p></td><td class="tcell1 right"><p>0.28</p></td></tr><tr><td class="tcell1"><p>Russian Federation</p></td><td class="tcell1 right"><p>0.17</p></td></tr><tr class="linebelow2"><td class="tcell1"><p>Uzbekistan</p></td><td class="tcell1 right"><p>0.12</p></td></tr><tr class="linebelow2"><td class="tcell1"><p>World total (conventional reserves in the ground)</p></td><td class="tcell1 right"><p>4.7</p></td></tr><tr class="linebelow2"><td class="tcell1"><p>Phosphate deposits</p></td><td class="tcell1 right"><p>22</p></td></tr><tr class="linebelow2"><td class="tcell1"><p>Seawater</p></td><td class="tcell1 right"><p>4500</p></td></tr></table><span class="figurenumber">Table 24.2</span>.

Leaving aside for a moment the usual questions about safety and waste-disposal, a key question is whether humanity could live for generations on fission. How great are the world wide supplies of uranium, and other fissionable fuels? Do we have only a few decades‚Äô worth of uranium, or do we have enough for millennia?</p><p>To estimate a &quot;sustainable&quot; power from uranium, I took the total recoverable uranium in the ground and in seawater, divided it fairly between 6 billion humans, and asked &quot;how fast can we use this if it has to last 1000 years?&quot;</p><p>Almost all the recoverable uranium is in the oceans, not in the ground: seawater contains 3.3¬†mg of uranium per m<sup>3</sup> of water, which adds up to 4.5 billion tons worldwide. I called the uranium in the ocean &quot;recoverable&quot; but this is a bit inaccurate ‚Äì most ocean waters are quite inaccessible, and the ocean conveyor belt rolls round only once every 1000 years or so; and no-one has yet demonstrated uranium-extraction from seawater on an in dustrial scale. So we‚Äôll make separate estimates for two cases: first using only mined uranium, and second using ocean uranium too.</p><p>The uranium ore in the ground that‚Äôs extractable at prices below $130 per kg of uranium is about one thousandth of this. If prices went above $130 per kg, phosphate deposits that contain uranium at low concentrations would become economic to mine. Recovery of uranium from phosphates is perfectly possible, and was done in America and Belgium before 1998. For the estimate of mined uranium, I‚Äôll add both the conventional uranium ore and the phosphates, to give a total resource of 27¬†million tons of uranium (table 24.2).</p><p>We‚Äôll consider two ways to use uranium in a reactor: (a) the widely-used <em>once-through method</em> gets energy mainly from the <sup>235</sup>U (which makes up just 0.7% of uranium), and discards the remaining <sup>238</sup>U; (b) <em>fast breeder reactors</em>, which are more expensive to build, convert the <sup>238</sup>U to fissionable plutonium-239 and obtain roughly 60 times as much energy from the uranium.<sup id="fnref-ch24n02"><a class="jsx-1614200154 footnote-ref" href="/sewtha#fn-ch24n02">ch24n02</a></sup></p><h3 id="once-through-reactors-using-uranium-from-the-ground">Once-through reactors, using uranium from the ground</h3><p><img src="/img/sewtha/figure195.gif"/></p><span class="figurenumber">Figure 24.4</span>.

However, since the potential contribution of ocean-uranium-based power is one of the biggest in our &quot;sustainable&quot; production list, it seems appropriate to discuss whether this uranium-power figure is at all economically plausible.</p><p>Japanese researchers have found a technique for extracting uranium from seawater<sup id="fnref-ch24n05"><a class="jsx-1614200154 footnote-ref" href="/sewtha#fn-ch24n05">ch24n05</a></sup> at a cost of $100‚Äì300 per kilogram of uranium, in comparison with a current cost of about $20/kg for uranium from ore. Because uranium contains so much more energy per ton than traditional fuels, this 5-fold or 15-fold increase in the cost of uranium would have little effect on the cost of nuclear power: nuclear power‚Äôs price is dominated by the cost of power-station construction and decommissioning, not by the cost of the fuel. Even a price of $300/kg would increase the cost of nuclear energy by only about 0.3 p per kWh. The expense of uranium extraction could be reduced by combining it with another use of seawater ‚Äì for example, power-station cooling.<sup id="fnref-ch24n06"><a class="jsx-1614200154 footnote-ref" href="/sewtha#fn-ch24n06">ch24n06</a></sup></p><p>We‚Äôre not home yet: does the Japanese technique scale up? What is the energy cost of processing all the seawater? In the Japanese experiment, three cages full of adsorbent uranium-attracting material weighing 350 kg collected &quot;more than 1 kg of yellow cake in 240 days;&quot; this figure corresponds to about 1.6 kg per year. The cages had a cross-sectional area of 48¬†m<sup>2</sup>. To power a once-through 1 GW nuclear power station, we need 160 000 kg per year, which is a production rate 100 000 times greater than the Japanese experiment‚Äôs. If we simply scaled up the Japanese technique, which accumulated uranium passively from the sea, a power of 1 GW would thus need cages having a collecting area of 4.8 km<sup>2</sup> and containing a weight of 350 000 tons of adsorbent material ‚Äì more than the weight of the steel in the reactor itself. To put these large numbers in human terms, if uranium were delivering, say, 22¬†kWh per day per person, each 1 GW reactor would be shared between 1¬†million people, each of whom needs 0.16 kg of uranium per year. So each person would require one tenth of the Japanese experimental facility, with a weight of 35 kg per person, and an area of <span class="darkblue">5¬†m<sup>2</sup></span> per person. The proposal that such uranium-extraction facilities should be created is thus similar in scale to proposals such as &quot;every person should have <span class="darkblue">10¬†m<sup>2</sup></span> of solar panels&quot; and &quot;every person should have a one-ton car and a dedicated parking place for it.&quot; A large investment, yes, but not absurdly off scale. And that was the calculation for once-through reactors. For fast breeder reactors, 60 times less uranium is required, so the mass per person of the uranium collector would be 0.5 kg.</p><h2 id="thorium">Thorium</h2><table><thead><tr><th>Country</th><th>Reserves (1000 tons)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Turkey</td><td>380</td></tr><tr><td>Australia</td><td>300</td></tr><tr><td>India</td><td>290</td></tr><tr><td>Norway</td><td>170</td></tr><tr><td>USA</td><td>160</td></tr><tr><td>Canada</td><td>100</td></tr><tr><td>South Africa</td><td>35</td></tr><tr><td>Brazil</td><td>16</td></tr><tr><td>Other countries</td><td>95</td></tr><tr><td>World total</td><td>1580</td></tr></tbody></table><span class="figurenumber">Table 24.7</span>.

Even if we have no guarantee against nuclear accidents in the future, I think the right way to assess nuclear is to compare it objectively with other sources of power. Coal power stations, for example, expose the public to nuclear radiation, because coal ash typically contains uranium. Indeed, according to a paper published in the journal <em>Science</em>, people in America living near coal-fired power stations are exposed to higher radiation doses than those living near nuclear power plants.<sup id="fnref-ch24n14"><a class="jsx-1614200154 footnote-ref" href="/sewtha#fn-ch24n14">ch24n14</a></sup></p><p>When quantifying the public risks of different power sources, we need a new unit. I‚Äôll go with &quot;deaths per GWy (gigawatt-year).&quot; Let me try to convey what it would mean if a power source had a death rate of 1 death per GWy. One gigawatt-year is the energy produced by a 1 GW power station, if it operates flat-out for one year. Britain‚Äôs electricity consumption is roughly 45 GW, or, if you like, 45 gigawatt-years per year. So if we got our electricity from sources with a death rate of 1 death per GWy, that would mean the British electricity supply system was killing 45 people per year. For comparison, 3000 people die per year on Britain‚Äôs roads. So, if you are <em>not</em> campaigning for the abolition of roads, you may deduce that &quot;1 death per GWy&quot; is a death rate that, while sad, you might be content to live with. Obviously, 0.1 deaths per GWy would be preferable, but it takes only a moment‚Äôs reflection to realize that, sadly, fossil-fuel energy production must have a cost greater than 0.1 deaths per GWy ‚Äì just think of disasters on oil rigs; helicopters lost at sea; pipeline fires; refinery explosions; and coal mine accidents: there are tens of fossil-chain fatalities per year in Britain.</p><p>So, let‚Äôs discuss the actual death rates of a range of electricity sources. The death rates vary a lot from country to country. In China, for example, the death rate in coal mines, per ton of coal delivered, is 50 times that of most nations. Figure 24.11 shows numbers from studies by the Paul Scherrer Institute and by a European Union project called ExternE, which made comprehensive estimates of all the impacts of energy production. According to the EU figures, coal, lignite, and oil have the highest death rates, followed by peat and biomass-power, with death rates above 1 per GWy.

Whereas the ash from ten coal-fired power stations would have a mass of four million tons per year (having a volume of roughly 40 litres per person per year), the nuclear waste from Britain‚Äôs ten nuclear power stations has a volume of just 0.84 litres per person per year ‚Äì think of that as a bottle of wine per person per year (figure 24.13).</p><p>Most of this waste is low-level waste. 7% is intermediate-level waste, and just 3% of it ‚Äì 25¬†ml per year ‚Äì is high-level waste.</p><p>The high-level waste is the really nasty stuff. It‚Äôs conventional to keep the high-level waste at the reactor for its first 40 years. It is stored in pools of water and cooled. After 40 years, the level of radioactivity has dropped 1000-fold. The level of radioactivity continues to fall; after 1000 years, if we <em>reprocess</em> the waste, separating off the uranium and plutonium for use in new nuclear fuel, then after 1000 years, the radioactivity of the high-level waste is about the same as that of uranium ore. Thus waste storage engineers need to make a plan to secure high-level waste for about 1000 years.<sup id="fnref-ch24n17"><a class="jsx-1614200154 footnote-ref" href="/sewtha#fn-ch24n17">ch24n17</a></sup></p><p><img src="/img/sewtha/figure201.gif"/></p><span class="figurenumber">Figure 24.13</span>.

At 25¬†ml per year, a lifetime‚Äôs worth of high-level nuclear waste would amount to less than 2 litres. Even when we multiply by 60¬†million people, the lifetime volume of nuclear waste doesn‚Äôt sound unmanageable: 105 000 cubic metres. That‚Äôs the same volume as 35 olympic swimming pools. If this waste were put in a layer one metre deep, it would occupy just one tenth of a square kilometre.</p><p>There are already plenty of places that are off-limits to humans. I may not trespass in your garden. Nor should you in mine. We are neither of us welcome in Balmoral. &quot;Keep out&quot; signs are everywhere.

Is it impossible to imagine making another one-square-kilometre spot ‚Äì perhaps deep underground ‚Äì off limits for 1000 years?</p><p>Compare this 25¬†ml per year per person of high-level nuclear waste with the other traditional forms of waste we currently dump: municipal waste ‚Äì 517 kg per year per person; hazardous waste ‚Äì 83 kg per year per person.</p><p>People sometimes compare possible new nuclear waste with the nuclear waste we already have to deal with, thanks to our existing old reactors. Here are the numbers for the UK. The projected volume of &quot;higher activity wastes&quot; up to 2120, following decommissioning of existing nuclear facilities, is 478 000¬†m<sup>3</sup>. Of this volume, 2% (about 10 000¬†m<sup>3</sup>) will be the high level waste (1290¬†m<sup>3</sup>) and spent fuel (8150¬†m<sup>3</sup>) that together contain 92% of the activity. Building 10 new nuclear reactors (10 GW) would add another 31 900¬†m<sup>3</sup> of spent fuel to this total.

And because we‚Äôve carefully expressed everything in this book in a single set of units, it‚Äôs quite easy to answer. First, let‚Äôs recap the key numbers about global energy balance from¬†<a class="jsx-1614200154 " href="../Text/chap01.xhtml#Carbon">chapter 1</a>: the average solar power absorbed by atmosphere, land, and oceans is 238 W/m<sup>2</sup>; doubling the atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> concentration would effectively increase the net heating by 4 W/m<sup>2</sup>. This 1.7% increase in heating is believed to be bad news for climate. Variations in solar power during the 11-year solar cycle have a range of 0.25 W/m<sup>2</sup>. So now let‚Äôs assume that in 100 years or so, the world population is 10 billion, and everyone is living at a European standard of living, using 125¬†kWh per day derived from fossil sources, from nuclear power, or from mined geothermal power. The area of the earth per person would be 51 000¬†m<sup>2</sup>. Dividing the power per person by the area per person, we find that the extra power contributed by human energy use would be 0.1 W/m<sup>2</sup>. That‚Äôs one fortieth of the 4 W/m<sup>2</sup> that we‚Äôre currently fretting about, and a little smaller than the 0.25 W/m<sup>2</sup> effect of solar variations. So yes, under these assumptions, human power production would <em>just</em> show up as a contributor to global climate change.</p><h4 id="i-heard-that-nuclear-power-cant-be-built-at-a-sufficient-rate-to-make-a-useful-contribution">I heard that nuclear power can‚Äôt be built at a sufficient rate to make a useful contribution.</h4><p><img src="/img/sewtha/figure202.gif"/></p><span class="figurenumber">Figure 24.14</span>.

The Guardian‚Äôs environment editor, summarizing a report from the <em>Oxford Research Group</em>, wrote &quot;For nuclear power to make any significant contribution to a reduction in global carbon emissions in the next two generations, the industry would have to construct nearly 3000 new reactors ‚Äì or about one a week for 60 years.

France has 59 of the world‚Äôs 429 operating nuclear reactors, so it‚Äôs plausible that the highest rate of reactor building for the whole planet was something like ten times France‚Äôs, that is, 34 new reactors per year. And the required rate (3000 new reactors over 60 years) is 50 new reactors per year. So the assertion that &quot;civil nuclear construction on this scale is a pipe dream, and completely unfeasible&quot; is poppycock. Yes, it‚Äôs a big construction rate, but it‚Äôs in the same ballpark as historical construction rates.</p><p>How reasonable is my assertion that the world‚Äôs maximum historical construction rate must have been about 34 new nuclear reactors per year?

Surely concentrating power should be even better than plain flat panels?</h4><p>Good question. The short answer is no. Concentrating solar power does not achieve a better power per unit land area than flat panels. The concentrating contraption has to track the sun, otherwise the sunlight won‚Äôt be focused right; once you start packing land with sun-tracking contraptions, you have to leave gaps between them; lots of sunlight falls through the gaps and is lost. The reason that people nevertheless make concentrating solar power systems is that, today, flat photovoltaic panels are very expensive, and concentrating systems are cheaper. The concentrating people‚Äôs goal is not to make systems with big power per unit land area. Land area is cheap (they assume). The goal is to deliver big power per dollar.</p><h4 id="but-if-flat-panels-have-bigger-power-density-why-dont-you-describe-covering-the-sahara-desert-with-them">But if flat panels have bigger power density, why don‚Äôt you describe covering the Sahara desert with them?</h4><p>Because I am trying to discuss practical options for large-scale sustainable power production for Europe and North Africa by 2050.

Power is extracted from the air-flow by turbines at the base of the chimney. Solar chimneys are fairly simple to build, but they don‚Äôt deliver a very impressive power per unit area. A pilot plant in Manzanares, Spain operated for seven years between 1982 and 1989. The chimney had a height of 195¬†m and a diameter of 10¬†m; the collector had a diameter of 240¬†m, and its roof had 6000¬†m<sup>2</sup> of glass and 40 000¬†m<sup>2</sup> of transparent plastic. It generated 44 MWh per year, which corresponds to a power per unit area of <span class="green">0.1 W/m<sup>2</sup></span>. Theoretically, the bigger the collector and the taller the chimney, the bigger the power density of a solar chimney becomes. The engineers behind Manzanares reckon that, at a site with a solar radiation of 2300¬†kWh/m<sup>2</sup> per year (262 W/m<sup>2</sup>), a 1000¬†m-high tower surrounded by a 7 km-diameter collector could generate 680 GWh per year, an average power of 78 MW.

It‚Äôs claimed that solar chimneys could generate electricity at a price similar to that of conventional power stations. I suggest that countries that have enough land and sunshine to spare should host a big bake-off contest between solar chimneys and concentrating solar power, to be funded by oil-producing and oil-consuming countries.</p><h4 id="what-about-getting-power-from-iceland-where-geothermal-power-and-hydroelectricity-are-so-plentiful">What about getting power from Iceland, where geothermal power and hydroelectricity are so plentiful?</h4><p><img src="/img/sewtha/figure211.gif"/></p><span class="figurenumber">Figure 25.11</span>.

Most of the big renewables are not turn-off-and-onable. When the wind blows and the sun comes out, power is there for the taking; but maybe two hours later, it‚Äôs not available any more. Nuclear power stations are not usually designed to be turn-off-and-onable either. They are usually on all the time, and their delivered power can be turned down and up only on a timescale of hours. This is a problem because, on an electricity network, consumption and production must be exactly equal all the time. The electricity grid can‚Äôt <em>store</em> energy. To have an energy plan that adds up every minute of every day, we therefore need <em>something easily turn-off-and-onable</em>. It‚Äôs commonly assumed that the easily turn-off-and-onable something should be a <em>source</em> of power that gets turned off and on to compensate for the fluctuations of supply relative to demand (for example, a fossil fuel power station<!-- -->!<!-- -->). But another equally effective way to match supply and demand would be to have an easily turn-off-and-onable <em>demand</em> for power ‚Äì a sink of power that can be turned off and on at the drop of a hat.</p><p><img src="/img/sewtha/figure213.gif"/></p><span class="figurenumber">Figure 26.2</span>.

During that period there were five days when output was less than 5% and one day when it was only 2%.</p><p><img src="/img/sewtha/figure214.gif"/></p><span class="figurenumber">Figure 26.3</span>. Electricity demand in Great Britain during two winter weeks of 2006. The left and right scales show the demand in national units (GW) and personal units (kWh/d per person) respectively. These are the same data as in figure 26.1.<p>Let‚Äôs quantify the fluctuations in country-wide wind power. The two issues are short-term changes, and long-term lulls. Let‚Äôs find the fastest short-term change in a month of Irish wind data. On 11th February 2007, the Irish wind power fell steadily from 415 MW at midnight to 79 MW at 4am. That‚Äôs a slew rate of 84 MW per hour for a country-wide fleet of capacity 745 MW. (By slew rate I mean the rate at which the delivered power fell or rose ‚Äì the slope of the graph on 11th February.) OK: if we scale British wind power up to a capacity of 33 GW (so that it delivers 10 GW on average), we can expect to have occasional slew rates of</p><p>[<!-- -->\text{84\ MW/h~} \times \ \frac{\text{33\ 000\ MW}}{\text{745\ MW}}\  = \text{~3700\ MW/h,}<!-- -->]</p><p>assuming Britain is like Ireland. So we need to be able to either power <em>up</em> replacements for wind at a rate of 3.7 GW per hour ‚Äì that‚Äôs 4 nuclear power stations going from no power to full power every hour, say ‚Äì <em>or</em> we need to be able to suddenly turn <em>down</em> our <em>demand</em> at a rate of 3.7 GW per hour.</p><p>Could these windy demands be met? In answering this question we‚Äôll need to talk more about &quot;gigawatts.&quot; Gigawatts are big country-sized units of power. They are to a country what a kilowatt-hour-per-day is to a person: a nice convenient unit. The UK‚Äôs average electricity consumption is about 40 GW. We can relate this national number to personal consumption: 1¬†kWh per day per person is equivalent to 2.5 GW nationally. So if every person uses 16¬†kWh per day of electricity, then national consumption is 40 GW.</p><p>Is a national slew-rate of <span class="darkblue">4 GW per hour</span> completely outside human experience? No. Every morning, as figure 26.3 shows, British demand climbs by about 13 GW between 6.30am and 8.30am. That‚Äôs a slew rate of <em><span class="darkblue">6.5 GW per hour</span></em>. So our power engineers already cope, every day, with slew rates bigger than 4GW per hour on the national grid. An extra occasional slew of 4 GW per hour induced by sudden wind variations is no reasonable cause for ditching the idea of country-sized wind farms. It‚Äôs a problem just like problems that engineers have already solved. We simply need to figure out how to match ever-changing supply and demand in a grid with no fossil fuels. I‚Äôm not saying that the wind-slew problem is <em>already</em> solved ‚Äì just that it is a problem of the same size as other problems that have been solved.</p><p>OK, before we start looking for solutions, we need to quantify wind‚Äôs other problem: long-term lulls. At the start of February 2007, Ireland had a country-wide lull that lasted five days. This was not an unusual event, as you can see in figure 26.2. Lulls lasting two or three days happen several times a year.</p><p>There are two ways to get through lulls. Either we can store up energy somewhere before the lull, or we need to have a way of reducing demand during the entire lull. (Or a mix of the two.) If we have 33 GW of wind turbines delivering an average power of 10 GW then the amount of energy we must either store up in advance or do without during a five-day lull is</p><p>10 GW¬†√ó¬†(5¬†√ó¬†24 h) = 1200 GWh.</p><p>(The gigawatt-hour (GWh) is the cuddly energy unit for nations. Britain‚Äôs electricity consumption is roughly 1000 GWh per day.)</p><p>To personalize this quantity, an energy store of 1200 GWh for the nation is equivalent to an energy store of 20¬†kWh per person. Such an energy store would allow the nation to go without 10 GW of electricity for 5 days; or equivalently, every individual to go without 4¬†kWh per day of electricity for 5 days.</p><h2 id="coping-with-lulls-and-slews">Coping with lulls and slews</h2><p>We need to solve two problems ‚Äì lulls (long periods with small renewable production), and slews (short-term changes in either supply or demand). We‚Äôve quantified these problems, assuming that Britain had roughly 33 GW of wind power. To cope with lulls, we must effectively store up roughly 1200 GWh of energy (20¬†kWh per person). The slew rate we must cope with is 6.5 GW per hour (or 0.1¬†kW per hour per person).</p><p>There are two solutions, both of which could scale up to solve these problems. The first solution is a centralized solution, and the second is decentralized. The first solution stores up energy, then copes with fluctuations by turning on and off a <em>source</em> powered from the energy store. The second solution works by turning on and off a piece of <em>demand</em>.</p><p>The first solution is <em>pumped storage</em>. The second uses the batteries of the <em>electric vehicles</em> that we discussed in Chapter 20. Before I describe these solutions, let‚Äôs discuss a few other ideas for coping with slew.</p><h3 id="other-supply-side-ways-of-coping-with-slew">Other supply-side ways of coping with slew</h3><p>Some of the renewables are turn-off-and-onable. If we had a lot of renewable power that was easily turn-off-and-onable, all the problems of this chapter would go away. Countries like Norway and Sweden have large and deep hydroelectric supplies which they can turn on and off. What might the options be in Britain?</p><p>First, Britain could have lots of waste incinerators and biomass incinerators ‚Äì power stations playing the role that is today played by fossil power stations. If these stations were designed to be turn-off-and-onable, there would be cost implications, just as there are costs when we have extra fossil power stations that are only working part-time: their generators would sometimes be idle and sometimes work twice as hard; and most generators aren‚Äôt as efficient if you keep turning them up and down, compared with running them at a steady speed. OK, leaving cost to one side, the crucial question is how big a turn-off-and-onable resource we might have. If all municipal waste were incinerated, and an equal amount of agricultural waste were incinerated, then the average power from these sources would be about 3 GW. If we built capacity equal to <em>twice</em> this power, making incinerators capable of delivering 6 GW, and thus planning to have them operate only half the time, these would be able to deliver 6 GW throughout periods of high demand, then zero in the wee hours. These power stations could be designed to switch on or off within an hour, thus coping with slew rates of 6 GW per hour ‚Äì but only for a maximum slew range of 6 GW<!-- -->!<!-- --> That‚Äôs a helpful contribution, but not enough slew range in itself, if we are to cope with the fluctuations of 33 GW of wind.</p><p>What about hydroelectricity? Britain‚Äôs hydroelectric stations have an average load factor of 20% so they certainly have the potential to be turned on and off. Furthermore, hydro has the wonderful feature that it can be turned on and off very quickly. Glendoe, a new hydro station with a capacity of 100 MW, will be able to switch from off to on in 30 seconds, for example. That‚Äôs a slew rate of 12 GW per hour in just one power station<!-- -->!<!-- --> So a sufficiently large fleet of hydro power stations should be able to cope with the slew introduced by enormous wind farms. However, the capacity of the British hydro fleet is <em>not</em> currently big enough to make much contribution to our slew problem (assuming we want to cope with the rapid loss of say 10 or 33 GW of wind power). The total capacity of traditional hydroelectric stations in Britain is only about 1.5 GW.</p><p>So simply switching on and off other renewable power sources is not going to work in Britain. We need other solutions.</p><h2 id="pumped-storage">Pumped storage</h2><p>Pumped storage systems use cheap electricity to shove water from a downhill lake to an uphill lake; then regenerate electricity when it‚Äôs valuable, using turbines just like the ones in hydroelectric power stations.</p><table><thead><tr class="header"><th>station</th><th>power (GW)</th><th>head (m)</th><th>volume<br/>(million m<sup>3</sup>)</th><th>energy stored<br/>(GWh)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr class="odd"><td>Ffestiniog</td><td>0.36</td><td>320‚Äì295</td><td>1.7</td><td>1.3</td></tr><tr class="even"><td>Cruachan</td><td>0.40</td><td>365‚Äì334</td><td>11.3</td><td>10</td></tr><tr class="odd"><td>Foyers</td><td>0.30</td><td>178‚Äì172</td><td>13.6</td><td>6.3</td></tr><tr class="even"><td>Dinorwig</td><td>1.80</td><td>542‚Äì494</td><td>6.7</td><td>9.1</td></tr></tbody></table><span class="figurenumber">Table 26.4</span>.

The Dinorwig power station ‚Äì an astonishing cathedral inside a mountain in Snowdonia ‚Äì also plays an insurance role: it has enough oomph to restart the national grid in the event of a major failure. Dinorwig can switch on, from 0 to 1.3 GW power, in 12 seconds.</p><p>Dinorwig is the Queen of the four facilities. Let‚Äôs review her vital statistics. The total energy that can be stored in Dinorwig is about 9 GWh. Its upper lake is about 500¬†m above the lower, and the working volume of 7¬†million m<sup>3</sup> flows at a maximum rate of 390¬†m<sup>3</sup>/s, allowing power delivery at 1.7 GW for 5 hours. The efficiency of this storage system is 75%.<sup id="fnref-ch26n05"><a class="jsx-1614200154 footnote-ref" href="/sewtha#fn-ch26n05">ch26n05</a></sup></p><p>If all four pumped storage stations are switched on simultaneously, they can produce a power of 2.8 GW. They can switch on extremely fast, coping with any slew rate that demand-fluctuations or wind-fluctuations could come up with. However the capacity of 2.8 GW is not enough to replace 10 GW or 33 GW of wind power if it suddenly went missing. Nor is the total energy stored (30 GWh) anywhere near the 1200 GWh we are interested in storing in order to make it through a big lull. Could pumped storage be ramped up? Can we imagine solving the entire lull problem using pumped storage alone?</p><h3 id="can-we-store-1200-gwh">Can we store 1200 GWh?</h3><p>We are interested in making much bigger storage systems, storing a total of 1200 GWh (about 130 times what Dinorwig stores). And we‚Äôd like the capacity to be about 20 GW ‚Äì about ten times bigger than Dinorwig‚Äôs. So here is the pumped storage solution: we have to imagine creating roughly 12 new sites, each storing 100 GWh ‚Äì roughly ten times the energy stored in Dinorwig. The pumping and generating hardware at each site would be the same as Dinorwig‚Äôs.</p><table class="center"><tr class="lineabove2 linebelow2"><th class="tcell1" colspan="4"><p>Ways to store 100 GWh</p></th></tr><tr class="linebelow2"><td class="tcell1"><p>drop from

Scanning a map of Scotland, one candidate location would use Loch Sloy as its upper lake and Loch Lomond as its lower lake. There is already a small hydroelectric power station linking these lakes. Figure 26.9 shows these lakes and the Dinorwig lakes on the same scale. The height difference between Loch Sloy and Loch Lomond is about 270¬†m. Sloy‚Äôs area is about 1.5 km<sup>2</sup>, and it can already store an energy of 20 GWh. If Loch Sloy‚Äôs dam were raised by another 40¬†m then the extra energy that could be stored would be about 40 GWh. The water level in Loch Lomond would change by at most 0.8¬†m during a cycle. This is less than the normal range of annual water level variations of Loch Lomond (2¬†m).</p><p>Figure 26.10 shows 13 locations in Scotland with potential for pumped storage. (Most of them already have a hydroelectric facility.) If ten of these had the same potential as I just estimated for Loch Sloy, then we could store 400 GWh<sup id="fnref-ch26n08"><a class="jsx-1614200154 footnote-ref" href="/sewtha#fn-ch26n08">ch26n08</a></sup> ‚Äì one third of the total of 1200 GWh that we were aiming for.</p><p><img src="/img/sewtha/figure217.gif"/></p><span class="figurenumber">Figure 26.10</span>. Lochs in Scotland with potential for pumped storage.<p>We could scour the map of Britain for other locations. The best locations would be near to big wind farms.

[<span class="websitetitle">www.ieahydro.org</span>](http://www.ieahydro.org/).<p>Thinking further outside the box, one could imagine getting away from lakes and reservoirs, putting half of the facility in an underground chamber. A pumped-storage chamber one kilometre below London has been mooted.</p><p>By building more pumped storage systems, it looks as if we could increase our maximum energy store from 30 GWh to 100 GWh or perhaps 400 GWh. Achieving the full 1200 GWh that we were hoping for looks tough, however. Fortunately there is another solution.</p><h2 id="demand-management-using-electric-vehicles">Demand management using electric vehicles</h2><p>To recap our requirements: we‚Äôd like to be able to store or do without about 1200 GWh, which is 20¬†kWh per person; and to cope with swings in supply of up to 33 GW ‚Äì that‚Äôs 0.5¬†kW per person. These numbers are delightfully similar in size to the energy and power requirements of electric cars. The electric cars we saw in Chapter 20 had energy stores of between 9¬†kWh and 53¬†kWh. A national fleet of 30¬†million electric cars would store an energy similar to 20¬†kWh per person<!-- -->!<!-- --> Typical battery chargers draw a power of 2 or 3¬†kW. So simultaneously switching on 30¬†million battery chargers would create a change in demand of about 60 GW<!-- -->!<!-- --> The average power required to power all the nation‚Äôs transport, if it were all electric, is roughly 40 or 50 GW. There‚Äôs therefore a close match between the adoption of electric cars proposed in Chapter 20 and the creation of roughly 33 GW of wind capacity, delivering 10 GW of power on average.</p><p>Here‚Äôs one way this match could be exploited: electric cars could be plugged in to smart chargers, at home or at work. These smart chargers would be aware both of the value of electricity, and of the car user‚Äôs requirements (for example, &quot;my car must be fully charged by 7am on Monday morning&quot;). The charger would sensibly satisfy the user‚Äôs requirements by guzzling electricity whenever the wind blows, and switching off when the wind drops, or when other forms of demand increase. These smart chargers would provide a useful service in balancing to the grid, a service which could be rewarded financially.</p><p>We could have an especially robust solution if the cars‚Äô batteries were exchangeable. Imagine popping in to a filling station and slotting in a set of fresh batteries in exchange for your exhausted batteries. The filling station would be responsible for recharging the batteries; they could do this at the perfect times, turning up and down their chargers so that total supply and demand were always kept in balance. Using exchangeable batteries is an especially robust solution because there could be millions of spare batteries in the filling stations‚Äô storerooms. These spare batteries would provide an extra buffer to help us get through wind lulls. Some people say, &quot;Horrors<!-- -->!<!-- --> How could I trust the filling station to look after my batteries for me? What if they gave me a duff one?&quot; Well, you could equally well ask today &quot;What if the filling station gave me petrol laced with water?&quot; Myself, I‚Äôd much rather use a vehicle maintained by a professional than by a muppet like me<!-- -->!</p><p>Let‚Äôs recap our options. We can balance fluctuating demand and fluctuating supply by switching on and off power <em>generators</em> (waste incinerators and hydroelectric stations, for example); by <em>storing</em> energy somewhere and regenerating it when it‚Äôs needed; or by switching <em>demand</em> off and on.</p><p>The most promising of these options, in terms of scale, is switching on and off the power demand of electric-vehicle charging. 30¬†million cars, with 40¬†kWh of associated batteries each (some of which might be exchangeable batteries sitting in filling stations) adds up to 1200 GWh. If freight delivery were electrified too then the total storage capacity would be bigger still.</p><p>There is thus a beautiful match between wind power and electric vehicles. If we ramp up electric vehicles at the same time as ramping up wind power, roughly 3000 new vehicles for every 3 MW wind turbine, and if we ensure that the charging systems for the vehicles are smart, this synergy would go a long way to solving the problem of wind fluctuations. If my prediction about hydrogen vehicles is wrong, and hydrogen vehicles turn out to be the low-energy vehicles of the future, then the wind-with-electric-vehicles match-up that I‚Äôve just described could of course be replaced by a wind-with-hydrogen match-up. The wind turbines would make electricity; and whenever electricity was plentiful, hydrogen would be produced and stored in tanks, for subsequent use in vehicles or in other applications, such as glass production.</p><h2 id="other-demand-management-and-storage-ideas">Other demand-management and storage ideas</h2><p>There are a few other demand-management and energy-storage options, which we‚Äôll survey now.</p><p>The idea of modifying the rate of production of stuff to match the power of a renewable source is not new. Many aluminium production plants are located close to hydroelectric power stations; the more it rains, the more aluminium is produced. Wherever power is used to create stuff that is storable, there‚Äôs potential for switching that power-demand on and off in a smart way. For example, reverse-osmosis systems (which make pure water from sea-water ‚Äì see¬†<a class="jsx-1614200154 " href="../Text/chap15.xhtml#desal">chapter 15</a>) are major power consumers in many countries (though not Britain). Another storable product is heat. If, as suggested in Chapter 21, we electrify buildings‚Äô heating and cooling systems, especially water-heating and air-heating, then there‚Äôs potential for lots of easily-turn-off-and-onable power demand to be attached to the grid. Well-insulated buildings hold their heat for many hours, so there‚Äôs flexibility in the timing of their heating. Moreover, we could include large thermal reservoirs in buildings, and use heat-pumps to pump heat into or out of those reservoirs at times of electricity abundance; then use a second set of heat pumps to deliver heat or cold from the reservoirs to the places where heating or cooling are wanted.</p><p>Controlling electricity demand automatically would be easy. The simplest way to do this is to have devices such as fridges and freezers listen to the frequency of the mains. When there is a shortage of power on the grid, the frequency drops below its standard value of 50 Hz; when there is a power excess, the frequency rises above 50 Hz. (It‚Äôs just like a dynamo on a bicycle: when you switch the lights on, you have to pedal harder to supply the extra power; if you don‚Äôt then the bike goes a bit slower.) Fridges can be modified to nudge their internal thermostats up and down just a little in response to the mains frequency,<sup id="fnref-ch26n09"><a class="jsx-1614200154 footnote-ref" href="/sewtha#fn-ch26n09">ch26n09</a></sup> in such a way that, without ever jeopardizing the temperature of your butter, they tend to take power at times that help the grid.</p><p>Can demand-management provide a significant chunk of virtual storage? How big a sink of power are the nation‚Äôs fridges? On average, a typical fridge-freezer draws about 18 W; let‚Äôs guess that the number of fridges is about 30million. So the ability to switch off all the nation‚Äôs fridges for a few minutes would be equivalent to 0.54 GW of automatic adjustable power. This is quite a lot of electrical power ‚Äì more than 1% of the national total ‚Äì and it is similar in size to the sudden increases in demand produced when the people, united in an act of religious observance (such as watching EastEnders), simultaneously switch on their kettles. Such &quot;TV pick-ups&quot; typically produce increases of demand of 0.6‚Äì0.8 GW. Automatically switching off every fridge would <em>nearly</em> cover these daily blips of concerted kettle boiling. These smart fridges could also help iron out short-time-scale fluctuations in wind power. The TV pick-ups associated with the holiest acts of observance (for example, watching England play footie against Sweden) can produce sudden increases in demand of over 2 GW. On such occasions, electricity demand and supply are kept in balance by unleashing the full might of Dinorwig.</p><p>To provide flexibility to the electricity-grid‚Äôs managers, who perpetually turn power stations up and down to match supply to demand, many industrial users of electricity are on special contracts that allow the managers to switch off those users‚Äô demand at very short notice. In South Africa (where there are frequent electricity shortages), radio-controlled demand-management systems are being installed in hundreds of thousands of homes, to control air-conditioning systems and electric water heaters.<sup id="fnref-ch26n10"><a class="jsx-1614200154 footnote-ref" href="/sewtha#fn-ch26n10">ch26n10</a></sup></p><h3 id="denmarks-solution">Denmark‚Äôs solution</h3><p>Here‚Äôs how Denmark copes with the intermittency of its wind power. The Danes effectively pay to use other countries‚Äô hydroelectric facilities as storage facilities. Almost all of Denmark‚Äôs wind power is exported to its European neighbours,<sup id="fnref-ch26n11"><a class="jsx-1614200154 footnote-ref" href="/sewtha#fn-ch26n11">ch26n11</a></sup> some of whom have hydroelectric power, which they can turn down to balance things out. The saved hydroelectric power is then sold back to the Danes (at a higher price) during the next period of low wind and high demand. Overall, Danish wind is contributing useful energy, and the system as a whole has considerable security thanks to the capacity of the hydro system.</p><p>Could Britain adopt the Danish solution? We would need direct large-capacity connections to countries with lots of turn-off-and-onable hydroelectric capacity; or a big connection to a Europe-wide electricity grid.</p><p>Norway has 27.5 GW of hydroelectric capacity. Sweden has roughly 16 GW. And Iceland has 1.8 GW. A 1.2 GW high-voltage DC interconnector to Norway was mooted in 2003, but not built. A connection to the Netherlands ‚Äì the BritNed interconnector, with a capacity of 1 GW ‚Äì will be built in 2010. Denmark‚Äôs wind capacity is 3.1 GW, and it has a 1 GW connection to Norway, 0.6 GW to Sweden, and 1.2 GW to Germany, a total export capacity of 2.8 GW, very similar to its wind capacity. To be able to export all its excess wind power in the style of Denmark, Britain (assuming 33 GW of wind capacity) would need something like a 10 GW connection to Norway, 8 GW to Sweden, and 1 GW to Iceland.</p><h3 id="a-solution-with-two-grids">A solution with two grids</h3><p><img src="/img/sewtha/figure221.gif"/></p><span class="figurenumber">Figure 26.12</span>. Electrical production and consumption on Fair Isle, 1995‚Äì96. All numbers are in kWh/d per person. Production exceeds consumption because 0.6¬†kWh/d per person were dumped<p>A radical approach is to put wind power and other intermittent sources onto a separate <em>second</em> electricity grid, used to power systems that don‚Äôt require reliable power, such as heating and electric vehicle battery-charging. For over 25 years (since 1982),<sup id="fnref-ch26n12"><a class="jsx-1614200154 footnote-ref" href="/sewtha#fn-ch26n12">ch26n12</a></sup> the Scottish island of Fair Isle (population 70, area 5.6 km<sup>2</sup>) has had two electricity networks that distribute power from two wind turbines and, if necessary, a diesel-powered electricity generator. Standard electricity service is provided on one network, and electric heating is delivered by a second set of cables. The electric heating is mainly served by excess electricity from the wind-turbines that would otherwise have had to be dumped. Remote frequency-sensitive programmable relays control individual water heaters and storage heaters in the individual buildings of the community. The mains frequency is used to inform heaters when they may switch on. In fact there are up to six frequency channels per household, so the system emulates seven grids. Fair Isle also successfully trialled a kinetic-energy storage system (a flywheel) to store energy during fluctuations of wind strength on a time-scale of 20 seconds.</p><h3 id="electrical-vehicles-as-generators">Electrical vehicles as generators</h3><p>If 30¬†million electric vehicles were willing, in times of national electricity shortage, to run their chargers in reverse and put power back into the grid, then, at 2¬†kW per vehicle, we‚Äôd have a potential power source of 60 GW ‚Äì similar to the capacity of all the power stations in the country. Even if only one third of the vehicles were connected and available at one time, they‚Äôd still amount to a potential source of 20 GW of power. If each of those vehicles made an emergency donation of 2¬†kWh of energy ‚Äì corresponding to perhaps 20% of its battery‚Äôs energy-storage capacity ‚Äì then the total energy provided by the fleet would be 20 GWh ‚Äì twice as much as the energy in the Dinorwig pumped storage facility.</p><h3 id="other-storage-technologies">Other storage technologies</h3><p>There are lots of ways to store energy, and lots of criteria by which storage solutions are judged. Figure 26.13 shows three of the most important criteria: energy density (how much energy is stored per kilogram of storage system); efficiency (how much energy you get back per unit energy put in); and lifetime (how many cycles of energy storage can be delivered before the system needs refurbishing). Other important criteria are: the maximum rate at which energy can be pumped into or out of the storage system, often expressed as a power per kg; the duration for which energy stays stored in the system; and of course the cost and safety of the system.</p><span id="chap26.xhtml#fig26.13"></span>![](/img/sewtha/figure220A.gif)<span class="figurenumber">Figure 26.13</span>.

The vanadium redox battery has a life of more than 10 000 cycles. It can be charged at the same rate that it is discharged (in contrast to lead-acid batteries which must be charged 5 times as slowly). Its efficiency is 70‚Äì75%, round-trip. The volume required is about 1¬†m<sup>3</sup> of 2-molar vanadium in sulphuric acid to store 20¬†kWh. (That‚Äôs 20 Wh/kg.)</p><p>So to store 10 GWh would require 500 000¬†m<sup>3</sup> (170 swimming pools) ‚Äì for example, tanks 2¬†m high covering a floor area of 500¬†m √ó 500¬†m.</p><p>Scaling up the vanadium technology to match a big pumped-storage system ‚Äì 10 GWh ‚Äì might have a noticeable effect on the world vanadium market, but there is no long-term shortage of vanadium. Current worldwide production of vanadium is 40 000 tons per year. A 10 GWh system would contain 36 000 tons of vanadium ‚Äì about one year‚Äôs worth of current production. Vanadium is currently produced as a by-product of other processes, and the total world vanadium resource is estimated to be 63¬†million tons.</p><h3 id="economical-solutions">&quot;Economical&quot; solutions</h3><p>In the present world which doesn‚Äôt put any cost on carbon pollution, the financial bar that a storage system must beat is an ugly alternative: storage can be emulated by simply putting up an extra gas-fired power station to meet extra demand, and shedding any excess electrical power by throwing it away in heaters.</p><h2 id="seasonal-fluctuations">Seasonal fluctuations</h2><span id="chap26.xhtml#fig26.16"></span>![](/img/sewtha/figure223.gif)<span class="figurenumber">Figure 26.16</span>. Gas demand (lower graph) and temperature (upper graph) in Britain during 2007.<p>The fluctuations of supply and demand that have the longest timescale are seasonal. The most important fluctuation is that of building-heating, which goes up every winter. Current UK natural gas demand varies throughout the year, from a typical average of 36¬†kWh/d per person in July and August to an average of 72¬†kWh/d per person in December to February, with extremes of 30‚Äì80¬†kWh/d/p (figure 26.16).</p><p>Some renewables also have yearly fluctuations ‚Äì solar power is stronger in summer and wind power is weaker.</p><p>How to ride through these very-long-timescale fluctuations?

And the plan needs to add up. The plan also needs a political and financial roadmap. Politics and economics are not part of this book‚Äôs brief, so here I will simply discuss what the technical side of a plan that adds up might look like.</p><p>There are many plans that add up. In this chapter I will describe five. Please don‚Äôt take any of the plans I present as &quot;the author‚Äôs recommended solution.&quot; My sole recommendation is this:</p><p><em>Make sure your policies include a plan that adds up<!-- -->!</em></p><p>Each plan has a consumption side and a production side: we have to specify how much power our country will be consuming, and how that power is to be produced. To avoid the plans‚Äô taking many pages, I deal with a cartoon of our country, in which we consume power in just three forms: transport, heating, and electricity. This is a drastic simplification, omitting industry, farming, food, imports, and so forth. But I hope it‚Äôs a helpful simplification, allowing us to compare and contrast alternative plans in one minute. Eventually we‚Äôll need more detailed plans, but today, we are so far from our destination that I think a simple cartoon is the best way to capture the issues.</p><p>I‚Äôll present a few plans that I believe are technically feasible for the UK by 2050. All will share the same consumption side. I emphasize again, this doesn‚Äôt mean that I think this is the correct plan for consumption, or the only plan. I just want to avoid overwhelming you with a proliferation of plans. On the production side, I will describe a range of plans using different mixes of renewables, &quot;clean coal,&quot; and nuclear power.</p><h2 id="the-current-situation">The current situation</h2><p>The current situation in our cartoon country is as follows. Transport (of both humans and stuff) uses 40¬†kWh/d per person. Most of that energy is currently consumed as petrol, diesel, or kerosene. Heating of air and water uses 40¬†kWh/d per person. Much of that energy is currently provided by natural gas. Delivered electricity amounts to 18¬†kWh/d/p and uses fuel (mainly coal, gas, and nuclear) with an energy content of 45¬†kWh/d/p. The remaining 27¬†kWh/d/p goes up cooling towers (25¬†kWh/d/p) and is lost in the wires of the distribution network (2¬†kWh/d/p). The total energy input to this present-day cartoon country is 125¬†kWh/d per person.</p><p><img src="/img/sewtha/figure226.gif"/></p><span class="figurenumber"><span id="chap27.xhtml#fig27.1">Figure</span> 27.1</span>. Current consumption per person in &quot;cartoon Britain 2008&quot; (left two columns), and a future consumption plan, along with a possible breakdown of fuels (right two columns). This plan requires that electricity supply be increased from 18 to 48¬†kWh/d per person of electricity.<h2 id="common-features-of-all-five-plans">Common features of all five plans</h2><p>In my future cartoon country, the energy consumption is reduced by using more efficient technology for transport and heating.</p><p>In the five plans for the future, transport is largely electrified. Electric engines are more efficient than petrol engines, so the energy required for transport is reduced. Public transport (also largely electrified) is better integrated, better personalized, and better patronized. I‚Äôve assumed that electrification makes transport about four times more efficient, and that economic growth cancels out some of these savings, so that the net effect is a halving of energy consumption for transport. There are a few essential vehicles that can‚Äôt be easily electrified, and for those we make our own liquid fuels (for example biodiesel or biomethanol or cellulosic bioethanol). The energy for transport is 18¬†kWh/d/p of electricity and 2¬†kWh/d/p of liquid fuels. The electric vehicles‚Äô batteries serve as an energy storage facility, helping to cope with fluctuations of electricity supply and demand. The area required for the biofuel production is about 12% of the UK (500¬†m<sup>2</sup> per person), assuming that biofuel production comes from 1%-efficient plants and that conversion of plant to fuel is 33% efficient. Alternatively, the biofuels could be imported if we could persuade other countries to devote the required (Wales-sized) area of agricultural land to biofuels for us.</p><p>In all five plans, the energy consumption of <strong>heating</strong> is reduced by improving the insulation of all buildings, and improving the control of temperature (through thermostats, education, and the promotion of sweater-wearing by sexy personalities). New buildings (all those built from 2010 onwards) are really well insulated and require almost no space heating. Old buildings (which will still dominate in 2050) are mainly heated by airsource heat pumps and ground-source heat pumps. Some water heating is delivered by solar panels (2.5 square metres on every house), some by heat pumps, and some by electricity. Some buildings located near to managed forests and energy-crop plantations are heated by biomass. The power required for heating is thus reduced from 40¬†kWh/d/p to 12¬†kWh/d/p of electricity, 1¬†kWh/d/p of solar hot water, and 5¬†kWh/d/p of wood.</p><p>The wood for making heat (or possibly combined heat and power) comes from nearby forests and energy crops (perhaps miscanthus grass, willow, or poplar) covering a land area of 30 000 km<sup>2</sup>, or 500¬†m<sup>2</sup> per person; this corresponds to 18% of the UK‚Äôs agricultural land, which has an area of 2800¬†m<sup>2</sup> per person. The energy crops are grown mainly on the lower-grade land, leaving the higher-grade land for food-farming. Each 500¬†m<sup>2</sup> of energy crops yields 0.5 oven dry tons per year, which has an energy content of about 7¬†kWh/d; of this power, about 30% is lost in the process of heat production and delivery. The final heat delivered is 5¬†kWh/d per person.</p><p>In these plans, I assume the current demand for <strong>electricity</strong> for gadgets, light, and so forth is maintained. So we still require 18¬†kWh(e)/d/p of electricity. Yes, lighting efficiency is improved by a switch to light-emitting diodes for most lighting, and many other gadgets will get more efficient; but thanks to the blessings of economic growth, we‚Äôll have increased the number of gadgets in our lives ‚Äì for example video-conferencing systems to help us travel less.</p><p>The total consumption of electricity under this plan goes up (because of the 18¬†kWh/d/p for electric transport and the 12¬†kWh/d/p for heat pumps) to 48¬†kWh/d/p (or 120 GW nationally). This is nearly a tripling of UK electricity consumption. Where‚Äôs that energy to come from? Let‚Äôs describe some alternatives. Not all of these alternatives are &quot;sustainable&quot; as defined in this book; but they are all low-carbon plans.</p><h2 id="producing-lots-of-electricity--the-components">Producing lots of electricity ‚Äì the components</h2><p>To make lots of electricity, each plan uses some amount of onshore and offshore wind; some solar photovoltaics; possibly some solar power bought from countries with deserts; waste incineration (including refuse and agricultural waste); hydroelectricity (the same amount as we get today); perhaps wave power; tidal barrages, tidal lagoons, and tidal stream power; perhaps nuclear power; and perhaps some &quot;clean fossil fuel,&quot; that is, coal burnt in power stations that do carbon capture and storage. Each plan aims for a total electricity production of 50¬†kWh/d/p on average ‚Äì I got this figure by rounding up the 48¬†kWh/d/p of average demand, allowing for some loss in the distribution network.</p><span id="chap27.xhtml#fig27.2"></span>![](/img/sewtha/figure228.gif)<span class="figurenumber">Figure 27.2</span>. Waste-to-energy facilities in Britain. The line shows the average power production assuming 1 kg of waste ‚Üí 0.5¬†kWh of electricity.<p>Some of the plans that follow will import power from other countries. For comparison, it may be helpful to know how much of our current power is imported today. The answer is that, in 2006, the UK imported 28¬†kWh/d/p of fuel ‚Äì 23% of its primary consumption. These imports are dominated by coal (18¬†kWh/d/p), crude oil (5¬†kWh/d/p), and natural gas (6¬†kWh/d/p). Nuclear fuel (uranium) is not usually counted as an import since it‚Äôs easily stored.</p><p>In all five plans I will assume that we scale up municipal waste incineration so that almost all waste that can‚Äôt usefully be recycled is incinerated rather than landfilled. Incinerating 1 kg per day per person of waste yields roughly 0.5¬†kWh/d per person of electricity.<sup id="fnref-ch27n01"><a class="jsx-1614200154 footnote-ref" href="/sewtha#fn-ch27n01">ch27n01</a></sup> I‚Äôll assume that a similar amount of agricultural waste is also incinerated, yielding 0.6¬†kWh/d/p. Incinerating this waste requires roughly 3 GW of waste-to-energy capacity, a ten-fold increase over the incinerating power stations of 2008 (figure 27.2). London (7¬†million people) would have twelve 30-MW waste-to-energy plants like the¬†<a class="jsx-1614200154 " href="../Text/chapD.xhtml#SELCHP">SELCHP¬†</a>plant in South London. Birmingham (1¬†million people) would have two of them. Every town of 200 000 people would have a 10 MW waste-to-energy plant. Any fears that waste incineration at this scale would be difficult, dirty, or dangerous should be allayed by figure 27.3, which shows that many countries in Europe incinerate <em>far</em> more waste per person than the UK; these incinerationloving countries include Germany, Sweden, Denmark, the Netherlands, and Switzerland ‚Äì not usually nations associated with hygiene problems<!-- -->!<!-- --> One good side-effect of this waste incineration plan is that it eliminates future methane emissions from landfill sites.</p><span id="chap27.xhtml#fig27.3"></span>![](/img/sewtha/figure227A.gif)<span class="figurenumber">Figure 27.3</span>. Left: Municipal solid waste put into landfill, versus amount incinerated, in kg per day per person, by country. Right: Amount of waste recycled versus amount landfilled or incinerated. Percentage of waste recycled is given beside each country‚Äôs name.[^ch27n02]<p>In all five plans, hydroelectricity contributes 0.2¬†kWh/d/p, the same as today.</p><p>Electric vehicles are used as a dynamically-adjustable load on the electricity network. The average power required to charge the electric vehicles is 45 GW (18¬†kWh/d/p). So fluctuations in renewables such as solar and wind can be balanced by turning up and down this load, as long as the fluctuations are not too big or lengthy. Daily swings in electricity demand are going to be bigger than they are today because of the replacement of gas for cooking and heating by electricity (see <a class="jsx-1614200154 " href="../Text/chap26.xhtml#fig26.16">figure 26.16</a>). To ensure that surges in demand of 10 GW lasting up to 5 hours can be covered, all the plans would build five new pumped storage facilities like Dinorwig (or upgrade hydroelectric facilities to provide pumped storage). 50 GWh of storage is equal to five Dinorwigs, each with a capacity of 2 GW. Some of the plans that follow will require extra pumped storage beyond this. For additional insurance, all the plans would build an electricity interconnector to Norway, with a capacity of 2 GW.</p><h2 id="producing-lots-of-electricity--plan-d">Producing lots of electricity ‚Äì plan D</h2><p>Plan D (&quot;D&quot; stands for &quot;domestic diversity&quot;) uses a lot of every possible domestic source of electricity, and depends relatively little on energy supply from other countries.</p><p>Here‚Äôs where plan D gets its 50¬†kWh/d/p of electricity from. Wind: 8¬†kWh/d/p (20 GW average; 66 GW peak) (plus about 400 GWh of associated pumped storage facilities). Solar PV: 3¬†kWh/d/p. Waste incineration: 1.1¬†kWh/d/p. Hydroelectricity: 0.2¬†kWh/d/p. Wave: 2¬†kWh/d/p. Tide: 3.7¬†kWh/d/p. Nuclear: 16¬†kWh/d/p (40 GW). &quot;Clean coal&quot;: 16¬†kWh/d/p (40 GW).</p><p><img src="/img/sewtha/figure229.gif"/></p><span class="figurenumber">Figure 27.4.</span> Plan¬†D<span id="chap27.xhtml#page208">To get</span>¬†8¬†kWh/d/p of wind requires a 30-fold increase in wind power over the installed power in 2008. Britain would have nearly 3 times as much wind hardware as Germany has now. Installing this much windpower offshore over a period of 10 years would require roughly 50 jack-up barges.<p>Getting 3¬†kWh/d/p from solar photovoltaics requires 6¬†m<sup>2</sup> of 20%efficient panels per person. Most south-facing roofs would have to be completely covered with panels; alternatively, it might be more economical, and cause less distress to the League for the Preservation of Old Buildings, to plant many of these panels in the countryside in the traditional Bavarian manner (<a class="jsx-1614200154 " href="../Text/chap06.xhtml#fig6.7">figure 6.7</a>).</p><p>The waste incineration corresponds to 1 kg per day per person of domestic waste (yielding 0.5¬†kWh/d/p) and a similar amount of agricultural waste yielding 0.6¬†kWh/d/p; the hydroelectricity is 0.2¬†kWh/d/p, the same amount as we get from hydro today.</p><p>The wave power requires 16 000 Pelamis deep-sea wave devices occupying 830 km of Atlantic coastline (see the map on p73). The tide power comes from 5 GW of tidal stream installations, a 2 GW Severn barrage, and 2.5 GW of tidal lagoons, which can serve as pumped storage systems too.</p><p>To get 16¬†kWh/d/p of nuclear power requires 40 GW of nukes, which is a roughly four-fold increase of the 2007 nuclear fleet. If we produced 16¬†kWh/d/p of nuclear power, we‚Äôd lie between Belgium, Finland, France and Sweden, in terms of per-capita production: Belgium and Finland each produce roughly 12¬†kWh/d/p; France and Sweden produce 19¬†kWh/d/p and 20¬†kWh/d/p respectively.</p><p>To get 16¬†kWh/d/p of &quot;clean coal&quot; (40 GW), we would have to take the current fleet of coal stations, which deliver about 30 GW, retrofit carbon-capture systems to them, which would reduce their output to 22 GW, then build another 18 GW of new clean-coal stations. This level of coal power requires an energy input of about 53¬†kWh/d/p of coal, which is a little bigger than the total rate at which we currently burn <em>all</em> fossil fuels at power stations, and well above the level we estimated as being &quot;sustainable&quot; in Chapter 23. This rate of consumption of coal is roughly three times the current rate of coal imports (18¬†kWh/d/p). If we didn‚Äôt reopen UK coal mines, this plan would have 32% of UK electricity depending on imported coal. Reopened UK coal mines could deliver an energy input of about 8¬†kWh/d/p, so either way, the UK would not be self-sufficient for coal.</p><p>Do any features of this plan strike you as unreasonable or objectionable? If so, perhaps one of the next four plans is more to your liking.</p><h2 id="producing-lots-of-electricity--plan-n">Producing lots of electricity ‚Äì plan N</h2><p>Plan N is the &quot;NIMBY&quot; plan, for people who don‚Äôt like industrializing the British countryside with renewable energy facilities, and who don‚Äôt want new nuclear power stations either. Let‚Äôs reveal the plan in stages.</p><p><img src="/img/sewtha/figure230.gif"/></p><span class="figurenumber">Figure 27.5.</span> Plan¬†N<p>First, we turn down all the renewable knobs from their very high settings in plan D to: wind: 2¬†kWh/d/p (5 GW average); solar PV: 0; wave: 0; tide: 1¬†kWh/d/p.</p><p>We‚Äôve just lost ourselves 14¬†kWh/d/p (35 GW nationally) by turning down the renewables. (Don‚Äôt misunderstand<!-- -->!<!-- --> Wind is still eight-fold increased over its 2008 levels.)</p><p>In the NIMBY plan, we reduce the contribution of nuclear power to 10¬†kWh/d/p (25 GW) ‚Äì a reduction by 15 GW compared to plan D, but still a substantial increase over today‚Äôs levels. 25 GW of nuclear power could, I think, be squeezed onto the existing nuclear sites, so as to avoid imposing on any new back yards. I left the clean-coal contribution unchanged at 16¬†kWh/d/p (40 GW). The electricity contributions of hydroelectricity and waste incineration remain the same as in plan D.</p><p>Where are we going to get an extra 50 GW from? The NIMBY says, &quot;not in my back yard, but in someone else‚Äôs.&quot; Thus the NIMBY plan pays other countries for imports of solar power from their deserts to the tune of 20¬†kWh/d/p (50 GW).</p><p>This plan requires the creation of five blobs each the size of London (44 km in diameter) in the transmediterranean desert, filled with solar power stations. It also requires power transmission systems to get 50 GW of power up to the UK. Today‚Äôs high voltage electricity connection from France can deliver only 2 GW of power. So this plan requires a 25-fold increase in the capacity of the electricity connection from the continent. (Or an equivalent power-transport solution ‚Äì perhaps ships filled with methanol or boron plying their way from desert shores.)</p><p>Having less wind power, plan N doesn‚Äôt need to build in Britain the extra pumped-storage facilities mentioned in plan D, but given its dependence on sunshine, it still requires storage systems to be built somewhere to store energy from the fluctuating sun. Molten salt storage systems at the solar power stations are one option. Tapping into pumped storage systems in the Alps might also be possible. Converting the electricity to a storable fuel such as methanol is another option, though conversions entail losses and thus require more solar power stations.</p><p>This plan gets 32% + 40% = 72% of the UK‚Äôs electricity from other countries.</p><h2 id="producing-lots-of-electricity--plan-l">Producing lots of electricity ‚Äì plan L</h2><p><img src="/img/sewtha/figure231.gif"/></p><span class="figurenumber">Figure 27.6.</span> Plan¬†L<p>Some people say &quot;we don‚Äôt want nuclear power<!-- -->!<!-- -->&quot; How can we satisfy them?

As in plan N, the delivery of desert power requires a large increase in transmission systems between North Africa and Britain; the Europe‚ÄìUK interconnectors would need to be increased from 2 GW to at least 40 GW.</p><p>Here‚Äôs where plan L gets its 50¬†kWh/d/p of electricity from.

I call this &quot;plan G,&quot; because I guess the Green Party don‚Äôt want nuclear or coal, though I think not all Greens would like the rest of the plan. Greenpeace, I know, <em>love</em> wind, so plan G is dedicated to them too, because it has <em>lots</em> of wind.</p><p><img src="/img/sewtha/figure232.gif"/></p><span class="figurenumber">Figure 27.7.</span> Plan¬†G<p>I make plan G by starting again from plan D, nudging up the wave contribution by 1¬†kWh/d/p (by pumping money into wave research and increasing the efficiency of the Pelamis converter) and bumping up wind power fourfold (relative to plan D) to 32¬†kWh/d/p, so that wind delivers 64% of all the electricity. This is a 120-fold increase of British wind power over today‚Äôs levels. Under this plan, <em>world</em> wind power in 2008 is multiplied by 4, with all of the increase being placed on or around the British Isles.</p><p>The immense dependence of plan G on renewables, especially wind, creates difficulties for our main method of balancing supply and demand, namely adjusting the charging rate of millions of rechargeable batteries for transport. So in plan G we have to include substantial additional pumpedstorage facilities, capable of balancing out the fluctuations in wind on a timescale of days. Pumped-storage facilities equal to 400 Dinorwigs can completely replace wind for a national lull lasting 2 days. Roughly 100 of Britain‚Äôs major lakes and lochs would be required for the associated pumped-storage systems.</p><p>Plan G‚Äôs electricity breaks down as follows. Wind: 32¬†kWh/d/p (80 GW average) (plus about 4000 GWh of associated pumped-storage facilities). Solar photovoltaics: 3¬†kWh/d/p. Hydroelectricity and waste incineration: 1.3¬†kWh/d/p. Wave: 3¬†kWh/d/p. Tide: 3.7¬†kWh/d/p.

On a level economic playing field with a strong price signal preventing the emission of CO<sub>2</sub>, we don‚Äôt expect a diverse solution with a wide range of powercosts; rather, we expect an economically optimal solution that delivers the required power at the lowest cost. And when &quot;clean coal&quot; and nuclear go head to head on price, it‚Äôs nuclear that wins. (Engineers at a UK electricity generator told me that the capital cost of regular dirty coal power stations is ¬£1 billion per GW, about the same as nuclear; but the capital cost of &quot;clean-coal&quot; power, including carbon capture and storage, is roughly ¬£2 billion per GW.) I‚Äôve assumed that solar power in other people‚Äôs deserts loses to nuclear power when we take into account the cost of the required 2000-km-long transmission lines (though van Voorthuysen (2008) reckons that with Nobel-prize-worthy developments in solar-powered production of chemical fuels, solar power in deserts would be the economic equal of nuclear power). Offshore wind also loses to nuclear, but I‚Äôve assumed that onshore wind costs about the same as nuclear.</p><p>Here‚Äôs where plan E gets its 50¬†kWh/d/p of electricity from. Wind: 4¬†kWh/d/p (10 GW average). Solar PV: 0. Hydroelectricity and waste incineration: 1.3¬†kWh/d/p. Wave: 0. Tide: 0.7¬†kWh/d/p. And nuclear: 44¬†kWh/d/p (110 GW).</p><p>This plan has a ten-fold increase in our nuclear power over 2007 levels. Britain would have 110 GW, which is roughly double France‚Äôs nuclear fleet. I included a little tidal power because I believe a well-designed tidal lagoon facility can compete with nuclear power.</p><p>In this plan, Britain has no energy imports (except for the uranium, which, as we said before, is not conventionally counted as an import).</p><p>Figure 27.9 shows all five plans.</p><p><img src="/img/sewtha/figure233.gif"/></p><span class="figurenumber">Figure 27.9.</span> All five plans.<h2 id="how-these-plans-relate-to-carbon-sucking-and-air-travel">How these plans relate to carbon-sucking and air travel</h2><p>1 t CO<sub>2</sub>e means greenhouse-gas emissions equivalent to one ton of CO<sub>2</sub>.</p><p>In a future world where carbon pollution is priced appropriately to prevent catastrophic climate change, we will be interested in any power scheme that can at low cost put extra carbon down a hole in the ground. Such carbon-neutralization schemes might permit us to continue flying at 2004 levels (while oil lasts). In 2004, average UK emissions of CO<sub>2</sub> from flying were about 0.5 t CO<sub>2</sub> per year per person. Accounting for the full greenhouse impact of flying, perhaps the effective emissions were about 1 t CO<sub>2</sub>e per year per person. Now, in all five of these plans I assumed that one eighth of the UK was devoted to the production of energy crops which were then used for heating or for combined heat and power. If instead we directed all these crops to power stations with carbon capture and storage ‚Äì the &quot;clean-coal&quot; plants that featured in three of the plans ‚Äì then the amount of extra CO<sub>2</sub> captured would be about 1 t of CO<sub>2</sub> per year per person. If the municipal and agricultural waste incinerators were located at clean-coal plants too so that they could share the same chimney, perhaps the total captured could be increased to 2 t CO<sub>2</sub> per year per person. This arrangement would have additional costs: the biomass and waste might have to be transported further; the carbon-capture process would require a significant fraction of the energy from the crops; and the lost building-heating would have to be replaced by more air-source heat pumps. But, if carbon-neutrality is our aim, it would be worth planning ahead by seeking to locate new clean-coal plants with waste incinerators in regions close to potential biomass plantations.</p><h2 id="all-these-plans-are-absurd">&quot;All these plans are absurd<!-- -->!<!-- -->&quot;</h2><p>If you don‚Äôt like these plans, I‚Äôm not surprised.

This sixth plan lies roughly in the middle of the first five, so I call it plan M (figure 28.1).</p><p>The areas and rough costs of these facilities are shown in table 28.3. For simplicity, the financial costs are estimated using today‚Äôs prices for comparable facilities, many of which are early prototypes. We can expect many of the prices to drop significantly. The rough costs given here are the building costs, and don‚Äôt include running costs or decommissioning costs. The &quot;per person&quot; costs are found by dividing the total cost by 60¬†million. Please remember, this is not a book about economics ‚Äì that would require another 400 pages<!-- -->!<!-- --> I‚Äôm providing these cost estimates only to give a rough indication of the price tag we should expect to see on a plan that adds up.</p><p>I‚Äôd like to emphasize that I am not advocating this particular plan ‚Äì it includes several features that I, as dictator of Britain, would not select. I‚Äôve deliberately included all available technologies, so that you can try out your own plans with other mixes.</p><p>For example, if you say &quot;photovoltaics are going to be too expensive, I‚Äôd like a plan with more wave power instead,&quot; you can see how to do it: you need to increase the wave farms eight-fold. If you don‚Äôt like the wind farms‚Äô locations, feel free to move them (but where to?). Bear in mind that putting more of them offshore will increase costs. If you‚Äôd like fewer wind farms, no problem ‚Äì just specify which of the other technologies you‚Äôd like instead. You can replace five of the 100 km<sup>2</sup> wind farms by adding one more 1 GW nuclear power station, for example.</p><p>Perhaps you think that this plan (like each of the five plans in the previous chapter) devotes unreasonably large areas to biofuels. Fine: you may therefore conclude that the demand for liquid fuels for transport must be reduced below the 2¬†kWh per day per person that this plan assumed; or that liquid fuels must be created in some other way.</p><h2 id="cost-of-switching-from-fossil-fuels-to-renewables">Cost of switching from fossil fuels to renewables</h2><p>Every wind farm costs a few million pounds to build and delivers a few megawatts. As a very rough ballpark figure in 2008, installing one watt of capacity costs one pound; one kilowatt costs 1000 pounds; a megawatt of wind costs a million; a gigawatt of nuclear costs a billion or perhaps two. Other renewables are more expensive. We (the UK) currently consume a total power of roughly 300 GW, most of which is fossil fuel. So we can anticipate that a major switching from fossil fuel to renewables and/or nuclear is going to require roughly 300 GW of renewables and/or nuclear and</p><p><img src="/img/sewtha/figure235.gif"/></p><span class="figurenumber">Figure 28.2.</span> A plan that adds up, for Scotland, England, and Wales.

(Anyone who doesn‚Äôt believe in climate change can skip this section and rejoin the rest of us next section.</p><h2 id="what-to-do-about-carbon-pollution">What to do about carbon pollution</h2><p>We are not on track to a zero-carbon future. Long-term investment is not happening. Carbon sequestration companies are not thriving, even though the advice from climate experts and economic experts alike is that sucking carbon dioxide from thin air will very probably be necessary to avoid dangerous climate change. Carbon is not even being captured at any coal power stations (except for one tiny prototype in Germany).</p><p>Why not?</p><p>The principal problem is that carbon pollution is not priced correctly. And there is no confidence that it‚Äôs going to be priced correctly in the future. When I say &quot;correctly,&quot; I mean that the price of emitting carbon dioxide should be big enough such that every running coal power station has carbon capture technology fitted to it.</p><p>Solving climate change is a complex topic, but in a single crude brushstroke, here is the solution: the price of carbon dioxide must be such that people <em>stop burning coal without capture</em>. Most of the solution is captured in this one brush-stroke because, in the long term, coal is the big fossil fuel. (Trying to reduce emissions from oil and gas is of secondary importance because supplies of both oil and gas are expected to decline over the next 50 years.)</p><p><img src="/img/sewtha/figure241.gif"/></p><span class="figurenumber">Figure 29.1.</span> A fat lot of good that did\! The price, in euro, of one ton of CO<sub>2</sub> under the first period of the European emissions trading scheme. Source: [<span class="websitetitle">www.eex.com</span>](http://www.eex.com).<p>So what do politicians need to do? They need to ensure that all coal power stations have carbon capture fitted. The first step towards this goal is for government to finance a large-scale demonstration project to sort out the technology for carbon capture and storage; second, politicians need to change the long-term regulations for power stations so that the perfected technology is adopted everywhere. My simple-minded suggestion for this second step is to pass a law that says that ‚Äì from some date ‚Äì <em>all coal power stations must use carbon capture.</em> However, most democratic politicians seem to think that the way to close a stable door is to create a market in permits-to-leave-doors-open. So, if we conform to the dogma that climate change should be solved through markets, what‚Äôs the market-based way to ensure we achieve our simple goal ‚Äì all coal power stations to have carbon capture? Well, we can faff around with carbon trading ‚Äì trading of permits to emit carbon and of certificates of carbon-capture, with onetonne carbon-capture certificates being convertible into one-tonne carbonemission permits. But coal station owners will invest in carbon capture and storage only if they are convinced that the price of carbon is going to be high enough for long enough that carbon-capturing facilities will pay for themselves. Experts say that a long-term guaranteed carbon price of something like $100 per ton of CO<sub>2</sub> will do the trick.</p><p>So politicians need to agree long-term reductions in CO<sub>2</sub> emissions that are sufficiently strong that investors have confidence that the price of carbon will rise permanently to at least $100 per ton of CO<sub>2</sub>. Alternatively they could issue carbon pollution permits in an auction with a fixed minimum price. Another way would be for governments to underwrite investment in carbon capture by guaranteeing that they will redeem captured-carbon certificates for $100 per ton of CO<sub>2</sub>, whatever happens to the market in carbon-emission permits.</p><p>I still wonder whether it would be wisest to close the stable door directly, rather than fiddling with an international market that is merely intended to encourage stable door-closing.</p><p><em>Britain‚Äôs energy policy just doesn‚Äôt stack up.

One attitude is &quot;Just let the market handle it. As fossil fuels become expensive, renewables and nuclear power will become relatively cheaper, and the rational consumer will prefer efficient technologies.&quot; I find it odd that people have such faith in markets, given how regularly markets give us things like booms and busts, credit crunches, and collapses of banks. Markets may be a good way of making some short-term decisions ‚Äì about investments that will pay off within ten years or so ‚Äì but can we expect markets to do a good job of making decisions about energy, decisions whose impacts last many decades or centuries?</p><p><img src="/img/sewtha/figure240.gif"/></p><span class="figurenumber">Figure 29.2.</span> What price would CO<sub>2</sub> need to have in order to drive society to make significant changes in CO<sub>2</sub> pollution? The diagram shows carbon dioxide costs (per tonne) at which particular investments will become economical, or particular behaviours will be significantly impacted, assuming that a major behavioural impact on activities like flying and driving results if the carbon cost doubles the cost of the activity. As the cost rises through $20‚Äì70 per tonne, CO<sub>2</sub> would become sufficiently costly that it would be economical to add carbon sequestration to new and old power stations. A price of $110 per tonne would transform large-scale renewable electricity-generation projects that currently cost 3p per kWh more than gas from pipedreams into financially viable ventures. For example, the proposed Severn barrage would produce tidal power with a cost of 6p per kWh, which is 3.3p above a typical selling price of 2.7p per kWh; if each 1000¬†kWh from the barrage avoided one ton of CO<sub>2</sub> pollution at a value of ¬£60 per ton, the Severn barrage would more than pay for itself. At $150 per tonne, domestic users of gas would notice the cost of carbon in their heating bills. A price of $250 per tonne would increase the effective cost of a barrel of oil by $100. At $370, carbon pollution would cost enough to significantly reduce people‚Äôs inclination to fly. At $500 per tonne, average Europeans who didn‚Äôt change their lifestyle might spend 12% of income on the carbon costs of driving, flying, and heating their homes with gas. And at $900 per tonne, the carbon cost of driving would be noticeable.<p>If the free market is allowed to build houses, we end up with houses that are poorly insulated. Modern houses are only more energy-efficient thanks to legislation.</p><p>The free market isn‚Äôt responsible for building roads, railways, dedicated bus lanes, car parks, or cycle paths. But road-building and the provision of car parks and cycle paths have a significant impact on people‚Äôs transport choices. Similarly, planning laws, which determine <em>where</em> homes and workplaces may be created and <em>how densely</em> houses may be packed into land have an overwhelming influence on people‚Äôs future travelling behaviour. If a new town is created that has no rail station, it is unlikely that the residents of that town will make long-distance journeys by rail. If housing and workplaces are more than a few miles apart, many people will feel that they have no choice but to drive to work.</p><p>One of the biggest energy-sinks is the manufacture of stuff; in a free market, many manufacturers supply us with stuff that has planned obsolescence, stuff that has to be thrown away and replaced, so as to make more business for the manufacturers.</p><p>So, while markets may play a role, it‚Äôs silly to say &quot;let the market handle it <em>all</em>.&quot; Surely we need to talk about legislation, regulations, and taxes.</p><h3 id="greening-the-tax-system">Greening the tax system</h3><p><em>We need to profoundly revise all of our taxes and charges.

The price of carbon needs to be high enough to promote investment in alternatives to fossil fuels, and investment in efficiency measures. Notice this is exactly the same policy as was suggested in the previous section. So, whether our motivation is fixing climate change, or ensuring security of supply, the policy outcome is the same: we need a carbon price that is stable and high. Figure 29.2 indicates very roughly the various carbon prices that are required to bring about various behaviour changes and investments; and the much lower prices charged by organizations that claim to &quot;offset&quot; greenhouse-gas emissions. How best to arrange a high carbon price? Is the European emissions trading scheme (figure 29.1) the way to go? This question lies in the domain of economists and international policy experts. The view of Cambridge economists Michael Grubb and David Newbery is that the European emissions trading scheme is not up to the job ‚Äì &quot;current instruments will not deliver an adequate investment response.&quot;</p><p><em>The Economist</em> recommends a carbon tax as the primary mechanism for government support of clean energy sources.<sup id="fnref-ch29n03"><a class="jsx-1614200154 footnote-ref" href="/sewtha#fn-ch29n03">ch29n03</a></sup> The Conservative Party‚Äôs Quality of Life Policy Group also recommends increasing environmental taxes and reducing other taxes ‚Äì &quot;a shift from <em>pay as you earn to pay as you burn</em>.&quot;<sup id="fnref-ch29n04"><a class="jsx-1614200154 footnote-ref" href="/sewtha#fn-ch29n04">ch29n04</a></sup> The Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution also says that the UK should introduce a carbon tax. &quot;It should apply upstream and cover all sectors.&quot;</p><p>So, there‚Äôs clear support for a big carbon tax, accompanied by reductions in employment taxes, corporation taxes, and value-added taxes. But taxes and markets alone are not going to bring about all the actions needed. The tax-and-market approach fails if consumers sometimes choose irrationally, if consumers value short-term cash more highly than long-term savings, or if the person choosing what to buy doesn‚Äôt pay all the costs associated with their choice.</p><p>Indeed many brands are &quot;<em>reassuringly expensive</em>.&quot; Consumer choice is not determined solely by price signals. Many consumers care more about image and perception, and some deliberately buy expensive.</p><p>Once an inefficient thing is bought, it‚Äôs too late.

Larry is responsible for maintaining the flat and providing the appliances in it, and Tina pays the monthly heating and electricity bills. Here‚Äôs the problem: Larry feels no incentive to invest in modifications to the flat that would reduce Tina‚Äôs bills. He could install more-efficient lightbulbs, and plug in a more economical fridge; these eco-friendly appliances would easily pay back their extra up-front cost over their long life; but it‚Äôs Tina who would benefit, not Larry. Similarly, Larry feels little incentive to improve the flat‚Äôs insulation or install double-glazing, especially when he takes into account the risk that Tina‚Äôs boyfriend Wayne might smash one of the windows when drunk. In principle, in a perfect market, Larry and Tina would both make the &quot;right&quot; decisions: Larry would install all the energy-saving features, and would charge Tina a slightly higher monthly rent; Tina would recognize that the modern and well-appointed flat would be cheaper to live in and would thus be happy to pay the higher rent; Larry would demand an increased deposit in case of breakage of the expensive new windows; and Tina would respond rationally and banish Wayne. However, I don‚Äôt think that Larry and Tina can ever deliver a perfect market. Tina is poor, so has difficulty paying large deposits. Larry strongly wishes to rent out the flat, so Tina mistrusts his assurances about the property‚Äôs low energy bills, suspecting Larry of exaggeration.</p><p>So some sort of intervention is required, to get Larry and Tina to do the right thing ‚Äì for example, government could legislate a huge tax on inefficient appliances; ban from sale all fridges that do not meet economy benchmarks; require all flats to meet high standards of insulation; or introduce a system of mandatory independent flat assessment, so that Tina could read about the flat‚Äôs energy profile before renting.</p><h2 id="investment-in-research-and-development">Investment in research and development</h2><p><em>We deplore the minimal amounts that the Government have committed to renewable-energy-related research and development (¬£12.2¬†million in 2002-03). ...

But second, I do think we should talk about it, contemplate how best to do it, and fund research into how to do it better, because capturing carbon from thin air may turn out to be our last line of defense, if climate change is as bad as the climate scientists say, and if humanity fails to take the cheaper and more sensible options that may still be available today.</p><p>Before we discuss capturing carbon from thin air, we need to understand the global carbon picture better.</p><h2 id="understanding-cosub2sub">Understanding CO<sub>2</sub></h2><p>When I first planned this book, my intention was to ignore climate change altogether. In some circles, &quot;Is climate change happening?&quot; was a controversial question.<sup id="fnref-ch31n01"><a class="jsx-1614200154 footnote-ref" href="/sewtha#fn-ch31n01">ch31n01</a></sup> As were &quot;Is it caused by humans?&quot; and &quot;Does it matter?&quot; And, dangling at the end of a chain of controversies, &quot;What should we do about it?&quot; I felt that sustainable energy was a compelling issue by itself, and it was best to avoid controversy. My argument was to be: &quot;Never mind when fossil fuels are going to run out; never mind whether climate change is happening; <em>burning fossil fuels is not sustainable anyway</em>; let‚Äôs imagine living sustainably, and figure out how much sustainable energy is available.&quot;</p><p>However, climate change has risen into public consciousness, and it raises all sorts of interesting back-of-envelope questions. So I decided to discuss it a little in the preface and in this closing chapter. Not a complete discussion, just a few interesting numbers.</p><p><img src="/img/sewtha/figure2451.gif"/></p><span class="figurenumber">Figure 31.1.</span> The weights of an atom of carbon and a molecule of CO<sub>2</sub> are in the ratio 12 to 44, because the carbon atom weighs 12 units and the two oxygen atoms weigh 16 each. 12 + 16 +16 = 44.<h3 id="units">Units</h3><p>Carbon pollution charges are usually measured in dollars or euros per ton of CO<sub>2</sub> so I‚Äôll use the <em>ton</em> of CO<sub>2</sub> as the main unit when talking about percapita carbon pollution, and the <em>ton of CO<sub>2</sub> per year</em> to measure rates of pollution. (The average European‚Äôs greenhouse emissions are equivalent to 11 tons per year of CO<sub>2</sub>; or 30 kg per day of CO<sub>2</sub>.) But when talking about carbon in fossil fuels, vegetation, soil, and water, I‚Äôll talk about tons of carbon. One ton of CO<sub>2</sub> contains 12/44 tons of carbon, a bit more than a quarter of a ton. On a planetary scale, I‚Äôll talk about gigatons of carbon (Gt C). A gigaton of carbon is a billion tons. Gigatons are hard to imagine, but if you want to bring it down to a human scale, imagine burning one ton of coal (which is what you might use to heat a house over a year). Now imagine everyone on the planet burning one ton of coal per year: that‚Äôs 6 Gt C per year, because the planet has 6 billion people.</p><h2 id="where-is-the-carbon">Where is the carbon?</h2><p>Where is all the carbon? We need to know how much is in the oceans, in the ground, and in vegetation, compared to the atmosphere, if we want to understand the consequences of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions.<sup id="fnref-ch31n02"><a class="jsx-1614200154 footnote-ref" href="/sewtha#fn-ch31n02">ch31n02</a></sup></p><p><img src="/img/sewtha/figure246.gif"/></p><span class="figurenumber">Figure 31.2.</span> Estimated amounts of carbon, in gigatons, in accessible places on the earth. (There‚Äôs a load more carbon in rocks too; this carbon moves round on a timescale of millions of years, with a long-term balance between carbon in sediment being subducted at tectonic plate boundaries, and carbon popping out of volcanoes from time to time. For simplicity I ignore this geological carbon.)<p>Figure 31.2 shows where the carbon is. Most of it ‚Äì 40 000 Gt ‚Äì is in the ocean (in the form of dissolved CO<sub>2</sub> gas, carbonates, living plant and animal life, and decaying materials). Soils and vegetation together contain about 3700 Gt. Accessible fossil fuels ‚Äì mainly coal ‚Äì contain about 1600 Gt. Finally, the atmosphere contains about 600 Gt of carbon.</p><p>Until recently, all these pools of carbon were roughly in balance: all flows of carbon out of a pool (say, soils, vegetation, or atmosphere) were balanced by equal flows into that pool. The flows into and out of the fossil fuel pool were both negligible. Then humans started burning fossil fuels. This added two extra <em>unbalanced</em> flows, as shown in figure 31.3.</p><p>The rate of fossil fuel burning was roughly 1 Gt C/y in 1920, 2 Gt C/y in 1955, and 8.4 Gt C in 2006. (These figures include a small contribution from cement production, which releases CO<sub>2</sub> from limestone.)<sup id="fnref-ch31n03"><a class="jsx-1614200154 footnote-ref" href="/sewtha#fn-ch31n03">ch31n03</a></sup></p><p><img src="/img/sewtha/figure247.gif"/></p><span class="figurenumber">Figure 31.3.</span> The arrows show two extra carbon flows produced by burning fossil fuels. There is an imbalance between the 8.4 Gt C/y emissions into the atmosphere from burning fossil fuels and the 2 Gt C/y take-up of CO<sub>2</sub> by the oceans. This cartoon omits the less-well quantified flows between atmosphere, soil, vegetation, and so forth.<p>How has this significant extra flow of carbon modified the picture shown in figure 31.2? Well, it‚Äôs not exactly known. Figure 31.3 shows the key things that <em>are</em> known. Much of the extra 8.4 Gt C per year that we‚Äôre putting into the atmosphere stays in the atmosphere, raising the atmospheric concentration of carbon-dioxide. The atmosphere equilibrates fairly rapidly with the surface waters of the oceans (this equilibration takes only five or ten years), and there is a net flow of CO<sub>2</sub> from the atmosphere into the surface waters of the oceans, amounting to 2 Gt C per year. (Recent research indicates this rate of carbon-uptake by the oceans may be reducing, however.)<sup id="fnref-ch31n04"><a class="jsx-1614200154 footnote-ref" href="/sewtha#fn-ch31n04">ch31n04</a></sup> This unbalanced flow into the surface waters causes ocean acidification, which is bad news for coral. Some extra carbon is moving into vegetation and soil too, perhaps about 1.5 Gt C per year, but these flows are less well measured. Because roughly half of the carbon emissions are staying in the atmosphere,<sup id="fnref-ch31n05"><a class="jsx-1614200154 footnote-ref" href="/sewtha#fn-ch31n05">ch31n05</a></sup> continued carbon pollution at a rate of 8.4 Gt C per year will continue to increase CO<sub>2</sub> levels in the atmosphere, and in the surface waters.</p><p>What is the long-term destination of the extra CO<sub>2</sub>? Well, since the amount in fossil fuels is so much smaller than the total in the oceans, &quot;in the long term&quot; the extra carbon will make its way into the ocean, and the amounts of carbon in the atmosphere, vegetation, and soil will return to normal. However, &quot;the long term&quot; means thousands of years. Equilibration between atmosphere and the <em>surface</em> waters is rapid, as I said, but figures 31.2 and 31.3 show a dashed line separating the surface waters of the ocean from the rest of the ocean. On a time-scale of 50 years, this boundary is virtually a solid wall. Radioactive carbon dispersed across the globe by the atomic bomb tests of the 1960s and 70s has penetrated the oceans to a depth of only about 400¬†m.<sup id="fnref-ch31n06"><a class="jsx-1614200154 footnote-ref" href="/sewtha#fn-ch31n06">ch31n06</a></sup> In contrast the average depth of the oceans is about 4000¬†m.</p><p>The oceans circulate slowly: a chunk of deep-ocean water takes about 1000 years to roll up to the surface and down again. The circulation of the deep waters is driven by a combination of temperature gradients and salinity gradients, so it‚Äôs called the thermohaline circulation (in contrast to the circulations of the surface waters, which are wind-driven).</p><p>This slow turn-over of the oceans has a crucial consequence: we have enough fossil fuels to seriously influence the climate over the next 1000 years.</p><h2 id="where-is-the-carbon-going">Where is the carbon going</h2><p>Figure 31.3 is a gross simplification. For example, humans are causing additional flows not shown on this diagram: the burning of peat and forests in Borneo in 1997 alone released about 0.7 Gt C. Accidentally-started fires in coal seams release about 0.25 Gt C per year.</p><p>Nevertheless, this cartoon helps us understand roughly what will happen in the short term and the medium term under various policies. First, if carbon pollution follows a &quot;business as usual&quot; trajectory, burning another 500 Gt of carbon over the next 50 years, we can expect the carbon to continue to trickle gradually into the surface waters of the ocean at a rate of 2 Gt C per year. By 2055, at least 100 Gt of the 500 would have gone into the surface waters, and CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations in the atmosphere would be roughly double their pre-industrial levels.</p><p><img src="/img/sewtha/figure248.gif"/></p><span class="figurenumber">Figure 31.4.</span> Decay of a small pulse of CO<sub>2</sub> added to today‚Äôs atmosphere, according to the Bern model of the carbon cycle. Source: Hansen et al. (2007).<p>If fossil-fuel burning were reduced to zero in the 2050s, the 2 Gt flow from atmosphere to ocean would also reduce significantly. (I used to imagine that this flow into the ocean would persist for decades, but that would be true only if the surface waters were out of equilibrium with the atmosphere; but, as I mentioned earlier, the surface waters and the atmosphere reach equilibrium within just a few years.) Much of the 500 Gt we put into the atmosphere would only gradually drift into the oceans over the next few thousand years, as the surface waters roll down and are replaced by new water from the deep.</p><p>Thus our perturbation of the carbon concentration might eventually be righted, but only after thousands of years. And that‚Äôs assuming that this large perturbation of the atmosphere doesn‚Äôt drastically alter the ecosystem. It‚Äôs conceivable, for example, that the acidification of the surface waters of the ocean might cause a sufficient extinction of ocean plant-life that a new vicious cycle kicks in: acidification means extinguished plant-life, means plant-life absorbs less CO<sub>2</sub> from the ocean, means oceans become even more acidic. Such vicious cycles (which scientists call &quot;positive feedbacks&quot; or &quot;runaway feedbacks&quot;) have happened on earth before: it‚Äôs believed, for example, that ice ages ended relatively rapidly because of positive feedback cycles in which rising temperatures caused surface snow and ice to melt, which reduced the ground‚Äôs reflection of sunlight, which meant the ground absorbed more heat, which led to increased temperatures. (Melted snow ‚Äì water ‚Äì is much darker than frozen snow.) Another positive feedback possibility to worry about involves methane hydrates, which are frozen in gigaton quantities in places like Arctic Siberia, and in 100-gigaton quantities on continental shelves. Global warming greater than 1 ¬∞C would possibly melt methane hydrates,<sup id="fnref-ch31n07"><a class="jsx-1614200154 footnote-ref" href="/sewtha#fn-ch31n07">ch31n07</a></sup> which release methane into the atmosphere, and methane increases global warming more strongly than CO<sub>2</sub> does.</p><p>This isn‚Äôt the place to discuss the uncertainties of climate change in any more detail. I highly recommend the books <em>Avoiding Dangerous Climate Change</em> (Schellnhuber et al., 2006) and <em>Global Climate Change</em> (Dessler and Parson, 2006). Also the papers by Hansen et al. (2007) and Charney et al.

In the future, perhaps pumping carbon <em>into</em> the ground is going to be big bucks. Assuming that inadequate action is taken now to halt global carbon pollution, perhaps a coalition of the willing will in a few decades pay to create a giant vacuum cleaner, and clean up everyone‚Äôs mess.</p><p>Before we go into details of how to capture carbon from thin air, let‚Äôs discuss the unavoidable energy cost of carbon capture. Whatever technologies we use, they have to respect the laws of physics, and unfortunately grabbing CO<sub>2</sub> from thin air and concentrating it requires energy. The laws of physics say that the energy required must be at least 0.2¬†kWh per kg of CO<sub>2</sub> (table 31.5). Given that real processes are typically 35% efficient at best, I‚Äôd be amazed if the energy cost of carbon capture is ever reduced below 0.55¬†kWh per kg.</p><p>Now, let‚Äôs assume that we wish to neutralize a typical European‚Äôs CO<sub>2</sub> output of 11 tons per year, which is 30 kg per day per person. The energy required, assuming a cost of 0.55¬†kWh per kg of CO<sub>2</sub>, is <span class="red">16.5¬†kWh per day per person</span>. This is exactly the same as <span class="red">British electricity consumption</span>. So powering the giant vacuum cleaner may require us to <em>double</em> our electricity production ‚Äì or at least, to somehow obtain extra power equal to our current electricity production.</p><p>If the cost of running giant vacuum cleaners can be brought down, brilliant, let‚Äôs make them. But no amount of research and development can get round the laws of physics, which say that grabbing CO<sub>2</sub> from thin air and concentrating it into liquid CO<sub>2</sub> requires at least 0.2¬†kWh per kg of CO<sub>2</sub>.</p><p>Now, what‚Äôs the best way to suck CO<sub>2</sub> from thin air?

Broecker imagines that the world could carry on burning fossil fuels at much the same rate as it does now, and 60¬†million CO<sub>2</sub>-scrubbers (each the size of an up-ended shipping container) will vacuum up the CO<sub>2</sub>. What energy does Lackner‚Äôs process require? In June 2007 Lackner told me that his lab was achieving 1.3¬†kWh per kg, but since then they have developed a new process based on a resin that absorbs CO<sub>2</sub> when dry and releases CO<sub>2</sub> when moist. Lackner told me in June 2008 that, in a dry climate, the concentration cost has been reduced to about 0.18‚Äì0.37¬†kWh of low-grade heat per kg CO<sub>2</sub>. The compression cost is 0.11¬†kWh per kg. Thus Lackner‚Äôs total cost is 0.48¬†kWh or less per kg. For a European‚Äôs emissions of 30 kg CO<sub>2</sub> per day, we are still talking about a cost of <span class="red">14¬†kWh per day</span>, of which <span class="red">3.3¬†kWh per day</span> would be electricity, and the rest heat.</p><p>Hurray for technical progress<!-- -->!<!-- --> But please don‚Äôt think that this is a small cost. We would require roughly a 20% increase in world energy production, just to run the vacuum cleaners.</p><h2 id="b-what-about-trees">B. What about trees?</h2><p><img src="/img/sewtha/figure348.gif"/></p><p>1 hectare = 10 000¬†m<sup>2</sup></p><p>Trees are carbon-capturing systems; they suck CO<sub>2</sub> out of thin air, and they don‚Äôt violate any laws of physics. They are two-in-one machines: they are carbon-capture facilities powered by built-in solar power stations. They capture carbon using energy obtained from sunlight. The fossil fuels that we burn were originally created by this process. So, the suggestion is, how about trying to do the opposite of fossil fuel burning? How about creating <span id="chap31.xhtml#page246">wood</span> and burying it in a hole in the ground, while, next door, humanity continues digging up fossil wood and setting fire to it? It‚Äôs daft to imagine creating buried wood at the same time as digging up buried wood. Even so, let‚Äôs work out the land area required to solve the climate problem with trees.</p><p>The best plants in Europe capture carbon at a rate of roughly 10 tons of dry wood per hectare per year<sup id="fnref-ch31n12"><a class="jsx-1614200154 footnote-ref" href="/sewtha#fn-ch31n12">ch31n12</a></sup> ‚Äì equivalent to about 15 tons of CO<sub>2</sub> per hectare per year ‚Äì so to fix a European‚Äôs output of 11 tons of CO<sub>2</sub> per year we need <span class="darkblue">7500 square metres</span> of forest per person. This required area of 7500 square metres per person is <em>twice the area of Britain</em> per person. And then you‚Äôd have to find somewhere to permanently store 7.5 tons of wood per person per year<!-- -->!<!-- --> At a density of 500 kg per m<sup>3</sup>, each person‚Äôs wood would occupy 15¬†m<sup>3</sup> per year. A lifetime‚Äôs wood ‚Äì which, remember, must be safely stored away and never burned ‚Äì would occupy 1000¬†m<sup>3</sup>. That‚Äôs five times the entire volume of a typical house. If anyone proposes using trees to undo climate change, they need to realise that country-sized facilities are required. I don‚Äôt see how it could ever work.</p><h2 id="c-enhanced-weathering-of-rocks">C. Enhanced weathering of rocks</h2><p>Is there a sneaky way to avoid the significant energy cost of the chemical approach to carbon-sucking? Here is an interesting idea: pulverize rocks that are capable of absorbing CO<sub>2</sub>, and leave them in the open air.<sup id="fnref-ch31n13"><a class="jsx-1614200154 footnote-ref" href="/sewtha#fn-ch31n13">ch31n13</a></sup> This idea can be pitched as the acceleration of a natural geological process. Let me explain.</p><p>Two flows of carbon that I omitted from figure 31.3 are the flow of carbon from rocks into oceans, associated with the natural weathering of rocks, and the natural precipitation of carbon into marine sediments, which eventually turn back into rocks. These flows are relatively small, involving about 0.2 Gt C per year (0.7 Gt CO<sub>2</sub> per year). So they are dwarfed by current human carbon emissions, which are about 40 times bigger. But the suggestion of enhanced-weathering advocates is that we could fix climate change by speeding up the rate at which rocks are broken down and absorb CO<sub>2</sub>. The appropriate rocks to break down include olivines or magnesium silicate minerals, which are widespread. The idea would be to find mines in places surrounded by many square kilometres of land on which crushed rocks could be spread, or perhaps to spread the crushed rocks directly on the oceans. Either way, the rocks would absorb CO<sub>2</sub> and turn into carbonates and the resulting carbonates would end up being washed into the oceans. To pulverize the rocks into appropriately small grains for the reaction with CO<sub>2</sub> to take place requires only <span class="red">0.04¬†kWh per kg of sucked CO<sub>2</sub></span>. Hang on, isn‚Äôt that smaller than the 0.20¬†kWh per kg required by the laws of physics? Yes, but nothing is wrong: the rocks themselves are the sources of the missing energy. Silicates have higher energy than carbonates, so the rocks pay the energy cost of sucking the CO<sub>2</sub> from thin air.</p><p>I like the small energy cost of this scheme but the difficult question is, who would like to volunteer to cover their country with pulverized rock?</p><h2 id="d-ocean-nourishment">D. Ocean nourishment</h2><p>One problem with chemical methods, tree-growing methods, and rock-pulverizing methods for sucking CO<sub>2</sub> from thin air is that all would require a lot of work, and no-one has any incentive to do it ‚Äì unless an international agreement pays for the cost of carbon capture. At the moment, carbon prices are too low.</p><p>A final idea for carbon sucking might sidestep this difficulty. The idea is to persuade the ocean to capture carbon a little faster than normal as a by-product of fish farming.<sup id="fnref-ch31n14"><a class="jsx-1614200154 footnote-ref" href="/sewtha#fn-ch31n14">ch31n14</a></sup></p><p>Some regions of the world have food shortages. There are fish shortages in many areas, because of over-fishing during the last 50 years. The idea of <em>ocean nourishment</em> is to fertilize the oceans, supporting the base of the food chain, enabling the oceans to support more plant life and more fish, and incidentally to fix more carbon. Led by Australian scientist Ian Jones, the ocean nourishment engineers would like to pump a nitrogencontaining fertilizer such as urea into appropriate fish-poor parts of the ocean. They claim that 900 km<sup>2</sup> of ocean can be nourished to take up about 5 Mt CO<sub>2</sub>/y. Jones and his colleagues reckon that the ocean nourishment process is suitable for any areas of the ocean deficient in nitrogen. That includes most of the North Atlantic. Let‚Äôs put this idea on a map. UK carbon emissions are about 600 Mt CO<sub>2</sub>/y. So complete neutralization of UK carbon emissions would require 120 such areas in the ocean. The map in figure 31.6 shows these areas to scale alongside the British Isles. As usual, a plan that actually adds up requires country-sized facilities<!-- -->!<!-- --> And we haven‚Äôt touched on how we would make all the required urea.</p><p><img src="/img/sewtha/figure249.gif"/></p><span class="figurenumber">Figure 31.6.</span> 120 areas in the Atlantic Ocean, each 900 km<sup>2</sup> in size. These make up the estimated area required in order to fix Britain‚Äôs carbon emissions by ocean nourishment.<p><img src="/img/sewtha/figure250.gif"/></p><p>While it‚Äôs an untested idea, and currently illegal, I do find ocean nourishment interesting because, in contrast to geological carbon storage, it‚Äôs a technology that might be implemented even if the international community doesn‚Äôt agree on a high value for cleaning up carbon pollution; fishermen might nourish the oceans purely in order to catch more fish.</p><p><em>Commentators can be predicted to oppose manipulations of the ocean, focusing on the uncertainties rather than on the potential benefits. They will be playing to the public‚Äôs fear of the unknown. People are ready to passively accept an escalation of an established practice (e.g., dumping CO<sub>2</sub> in the atmosphere) while being wary of innovations that might improve their future well being. They have an uneven aversion to risk.</em></p><cite>Ian Jones</cite><p><em>We, humanity, cannot release to the atmosphere all, or even most, fossil fuel CO<sub>2</sub>.

How does it depend on properties of the car? Could we make cars that are 100 times more efficient? Let‚Äôs make a simple cartoon of car-driving, to describe where the energy goes. The energy in a typical fossil-fuel car goes to four main destinations, all of which we will explore:</p><ol><li>speeding up then slowing down using the brakes;</li><li>air resistance;</li><li>rolling resistance;</li><li>heat ‚Äì 75% of the energy is thrown away as heat, because the energy-conversion chain is inefficient.</li></ol><p>The key formula for most of the calculations in this book is:</p><p>[<!-- -->\text{kinetic\ energy} = \frac{1}{2}mv^{2}<!-- -->]</p><p>For example, a car of mass <em>m</em> = 1000¬†kg moving at 100 km per hour or <em>v</em> = 28¬†m/s has an energy of</p><p>[<!-- -->\frac{1}{2}mv^{2} \simeq \text{390~000~J} \simeq \text{0.1~kWh.}<!-- -->]</p><p><img src="/img/sewtha/figure253.gif"/></p><span class="figurenumber">Figure A.2.</span>Our cartoon: a car moves at speed *v* between stops separated by a distance *d*.<p>Initially our cartoon will ignore rolling resistance; we‚Äôll add in this effect later in the chapter.</p><p>Assume the driver accelerates rapidly up to a cruising speed <em>v</em>, and maintains that speed for a distance <em>d</em>, which is the distance between traffic lights, stop signs, or congestion events. At this point, he slams on the brakes and turns all his kinetic energy into heat in the brakes. (This vehicle doesn‚Äôt have fancy regenerative braking.) Once he‚Äôs able to move again, he accelerates back up to his cruising speed, <em>v</em>. This acceleration gives the car kinetic energy; braking throws that kinetic energy away.</p><p>Energy goes not only into the brakes: while the car is moving, it makes air swirl around. A car leaves behind it a tube of swirling air, moving at a speed similar to <em>v</em>. Which of these two forms of energy is the bigger: kinetic energy of the swirling air, or heat in the brakes? Let‚Äôs work it out.</p><p>The car speeds up and slows down once in each duration <em>d/v</em>. The rate at which energy pours into the brakes is:</p><p>[<!-- -->\begin{matrix}

(For a streamlined car, <em>A</em> is usually a little smaller than the frontal area <em>A</em><sub>car</sub>, and the ratio of the tube‚Äôs effective cross-sectional area to the car area is called the drag coefficient <em>c</em><sub>d</sub>. Throughout the following equations, <em>A</em> means the effective area of the car, <em>c</em><sub>d</sub><em>A</em><sub>car</sub>.) The tube has mass <em>m</em><sub>air</sub> = <em>œÅAvt</em> (where <em>œÅ</em> is the density of air) and swirls at speed <em>v</em>, so its kinetic energy is:</p><p>I‚Äôm using this formula:

\end{matrix}<!-- -->]</p><p>Both forms of energy dissipation scale as <em>v</em><sup>3</sup>. So this cartoon predicts that a driver who halves his speed <em>v</em> makes his power consumption 8 times smaller. If he ends up driving the same total distance, his journey will take twice as long, but the total energy consumed by his journey will be four times smaller.</p><p>Which of the two forms of energy dissipation ‚Äì brakes or air-swirling ‚Äì is the bigger?

And <em>œÅAd</em> is the mass of that tube of air. So we have a very simple situation: energy dissipation is dominated by kinetic-energy-being-dumped-into-the-brakes if the mass of the car is <em>bigger</em> than the mass of the tube of air from one stop sign to the next; and energy dissipation is dominated by making-air-swirl if the mass of the car is <em>smaller</em> (figure A.4).</p><p>Let‚Äôs work out the special distance <em>d</em>*<!-- --> between stop signs, below which the dissipation is braking-dominated and above which it is air-swirling dominated (also known as drag-dominated).

Pushing yourself along on a bicycle requires energy for the same reason as a car: you‚Äôre making air swirl around. Now, we could do all the calculations from scratch, replacing car-numbers by bike-numbers. But there‚Äôs a simple trick we can use to get the answer for the bike from the answer for the car. The energy consumed by a car, per distance travelled, is the power-consumption associated with air-swirling,</p><p>[<!-- -->4 \times \frac{\text{1}}{\text{2}}\rho Av^{3}<!-- -->]</p><p>divided by the speed, <em>v</em>; that is,</p><p>[<!-- -->\text{energy\ per\ distance} = 4 \times \frac{\text{1}}{\text{2}}\rho Av^{2}<!-- -->]</p><p>The &quot;4&quot; came from engine inefficiency; <em>œÅ</em> is the density of air; the area <!-- -->(<!-- -->A = c<em>{\text{d}}A</em>{\text{car}}<!-- -->)<!-- --> is the effective frontal area of a car; and <em>v</em> is its speed.

Collectively, these forms of energy consumption are called <em>rolling resistance</em>. The standard model of rolling resistance asserts that the force of rolling resistance is simply proportional to the weight of the vehicle, independent of the speed. The constant of proportionality is called the coefficient of rolling resistance, <em>C</em><span class="smallfont1"><sub>rr</sub></span>. Table A.8 gives some typical values.</p><table><thead><tr><th>wheel</th><th><em>C</em><sub>rr</sub></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>train (steel on steel)</td><td>0.002</td></tr><tr><td>bicycle tyre</td><td>0.005</td></tr><tr><td>truck rubber tyres</td><td>0.007</td></tr><tr><td>car rubber tyres</td><td>0.010</td></tr></tbody></table><span class="figurenumber">Table A.8.</span> The rolling resistance is equal to the weight multiplied by the coefficient of rolling resistance, *C*<sub>rr</sub>. The rolling resistance includes the force due to wheel flex, friction losses in the wheel bearings, shaking and vibration of both the roadbed and the vehicle (including energy absorbed by the vehicle‚Äôs shock absorbers), and sliding of the wheels on the road or rail. The coefficient varies with the quality of the road, with the material the wheel is made from, and with temperature. The numbers given here assume smooth roads. \[[<span class="websitetitle">2bhu35</span>](http://tinyurl.com/2bhu35)\]<h5 id="cars"><em>Cars</em></h5><p>The coefficient of rolling resistance for a car is about 0.01. The effect of rolling resistance is just like perpetually driving up a hill with a slope of one in a hundred. So rolling friction is about 100 newtons per ton, independent of speed. You can confirm this by pushing a typical one-ton car along a flat road. Once you‚Äôve got it moving, you‚Äôll find you can keep it moving with one hand. (100 newtons is the weight of 100 apples.) So at a speed of 31¬†m/s (70¬†mph), the power required to overcome rolling resistance, for a one-ton vehicle, is</p><p>[<!-- -->\text{force} \times \text{velocity} = \left( \text{100\ newtons} \right) \times \left( \text{31\ m/s} \right) = \text{3100\ W;}<!-- -->]</p><p>which, allowing for an engine efficiency of 25%, requires 12¬†kW of power to go into the engine; whereas the power required to overcome drag was estimated above to be 80¬†kW. So, at high speed, about 15% of the power is required for rolling resistance.</p><p><img src="/img/sewtha/figure321.gif"/></p><span class="figurenumber">Figure A.9.</span> Simple theory of car fuel consumption (energy per distance) when driving at steady speed.

They have a point: most cars‚Äô engines have an optimum revolution rate, and the choice of gears of the car determines a range of speeds at which the optimum engine efficiency can be delivered. If my suggested experiment of halving the car‚Äôs speed takes the car out of this designed range of speeds, the consumption might not fall by as much as four-fold. My tacit assumption that the engine‚Äôs efficiency is the same at all speeds and all loads led to the conclusion that it‚Äôs always good (in terms of miles per gallon) to travel slower; but if the engine‚Äôs efficiency drops off at low speeds, then the most fuel-efficient speed might be at an intermediate speed that makes a compromise between going slow and keeping the engine efficient. For the BMW 318ti in figure A.12, for example, the optimum speed is about 60 km/h. But if society were to decide that car speeds should be reduced, there is nothing to stop engines and gears being redesigned so that the peak engine efficiency was found at the right speed. As further evidence that the power a car requires really does increase as the cube of speed, figure A.13 shows the engine power versus the top speeds of a range of cars. The line shows the relationship &quot;power proportional to <em>v</em><sup>3</sup>.&quot;</p><h3 id="electric-cars-is-range-a-problem">Electric cars: is range a problem?</h3><p>People often say that the range of electric cars is not big enough. Electric car advocates say &quot;no problem, we can just put in more batteries&quot; ‚Äì and that‚Äôs true, but we need to work out what effect the extra batteries have on the energy consumption. The answer depends sensitively on what energy density we assume the batteries deliver: for an energy density of 40 Wh/kg (typical of lead-acid batteries), we‚Äôll see that it‚Äôs hard to push the range beyond 200 or 300 km; but for an energy density of 120 Wh/kg (typical of various lithium-based batteries), a range of 500¬†km is easily achievable.</p><p><img src="/img/sewtha/figure258.gif"/></p><span class="figurenumber">Figure A.14.</span> Theory of electric car range (horizontal axis) and transport cost (vertical axis) as a function of battery mass, for two battery technologies. A car with 500 kg of old batteries, with an energy density of 40 Wh per kg, has a range of 180 km. With the same weight of modern batteries, delivering 120 Wh per kg, an electric car can have a range of more than 500 km. Both cars would have an energy cost of about 13¬†kWh per 100 km. These numbers allow for a battery charging efficiency of 85%.<p>Let‚Äôs assume that the mass of the car and occupants is 740 kg, <em>without</em> any batteries. In due course we‚Äôll add 100 kg, 200 kg, 500 kg, or perhaps 1000 kg of batteries. Let‚Äôs assume a typical speed of 50 km/h (30¬†mph); a drag-area of 0.8¬†m<sup>2</sup>; a rolling resistance of 0.01; a distance between stops of 500¬†m; an engine efficiency of 85%; and that during stops and starts, regenerative braking recovers half of the kinetic energy of the car. Charging up the car from the mains is assumed to be 85% efficient. Figure A.14 shows the transport cost of the car versus its range, as we vary the amount of battery on board. The upper curve shows the result for a battery whose energy density is 40 Wh/kg (old-style lead-acid batteries). The range is limited by a wall at about 500 km. To get close to this maximum range, we have to take along comically large batteries: for a range of 400 km, for example, 2000 kg of batteries are required, and the transport cost is above 25¬†kWh per 100 km. If we are content with a range of 180 km, however, we can get by with 500 kg of batteries. Things get much better when we switch to lighter lithium-ion batteries. At an energy density of 120 Wh/kg, electric cars with 500 kg of batteries can easily deliver a range of 500 km. The transport cost is predicted to be about 13¬†kWh per 100 km.</p><p>It thus seems to me that the range problem has been solved by the advent of modern¬†<span id="chapA.xhtml#batteries">batteries</span>. It would be nice to have even better batteries, but an energy density of 120 Wh per kg is already good enough, as long as we‚Äôre happy for the batteries in a car to weigh up to 500 kg. In practice I imagine most people would be content to have a range of 300 km, which can be delivered by 250 kg of batteries. If these batteries were divided into ten 25 kg chunks, separately unpluggable, then a car user could keep just four of the ten chunks on board when he‚Äôs doing regular commuting (100 kg gives a range of 140 km); and collect an extra six chunks from a battery-recharging station when he wants to make longer-range trips. During long-range trips, he would exchange his batteries for a fresh set at a battery-exchange station every 300 km or so.</p><h2 id="notes-and-further-reading-27">Notes and further reading</h2><p><img src="/img/sewtha/figure259.gif"/></p><span class="figurenumber">Figure A.15.</span> The Wartsila-Sulzer RTA96-C 14-cylinder two-stroke diesel engine. 27¬†m long and 13.5¬†m high.

The maximum fraction of the incoming energy that can be extracted by a disc-like windmill was worked out by a German physicist called Albert Betz <a class="jsx-1614200154 " href="/sewtha#chapB.xhtml#chBn01"><span class="darkred">[<!-- -->1<!-- -->]</span></a> in 1919.

In fact, real windmills are designed with particular wind speeds in mind; if the wind speed is significantly greater than the turbine‚Äôs ideal speed, it has to be switched off.</p><p>As an example, let‚Äôs assume a diameter of <em>d</em> = 25m, and a hub height of 32¬†m, which is roughly the size of the lone windmill above the city of Wellington, New Zealand (figure B.3).

The transport efficiency is close to its physical limit. The aerodynamics community say that the shape of planes could be improved a little by a switch to blended-wing bodies, and that the drag coefficient could be reduced a little by laminar flow control, a technology that reduces the growth of turbulence over a wing by sucking a little air through small perforations in the surface (Braslow, 1999). Adding laminar flow control to existing planes would deliver a 15% improvement in drag coefficient, and the change of shape to blended-wing bodies is predicted to improve the drag coefficient by about 18% (Green, 2006). And equation (C.26) says that the transport cost is proportional to the square root of the drag coefficient, so improvements of <em>c</em><span class="smallfont1"><sub>d</sub></span> by 15% or 18% would improve transport cost by 7.5% and 9% respectively.</p><p><img src="/img/sewtha/figure278.gif"/></p><span class="figurenumber">Figure C.10.</span> &quot;Fasten your cufflinks.&quot; A Bombardier Learjet 60XR carrying 8 passengers at 780 km/h has a transport cost of <span class="mauve">150¬†kWh per 100 passenger-km</span>.

Half of the work done by a plane goes into <em>staying up</em>; the other half goes into <em>keeping going</em>. The fuel efficiency at the optimal speed, expressed as an energy-per-distance-travelled, was found in the force (C.22), and it was simply proportional to the weight of the plane; the constant of proportionality is the drag-to-lift ratio, which is determined by the shape of the plane. So whereas lowering speed-limits for cars would reduce the energy consumed per distance travelled, there is no point in considering speed-limits for planes. Planes that are up in the air have optimal speeds, different for each plane, depending on its weight, and they already go at their optimal speeds. If you ordered a plane to go slower, its energy consumption would <em>increase</em>. The only way to make a plane consume fuel more efficiently is to put it on the ground and stop it. Planes have been fantastically optimized, and there is no prospect of significant improvements in plane efficiency.

You might think that bigger planes have a bigger range, but the prediction of our model is startlingly simple.

So our cartoon plane would be equally happy to fly at any height; there isn‚Äôt an optimum density; the plane could achieve the same miles-per-gallon in any density; but the optimum <em>speed</em> does depend on the density (<em>v</em><sup>2</sup> ~ 1/<em>œÅ</em>, equation (C.16)). So all else being equal, our cartoon plane would have the shortest journey time if it flew in the lowest-density air possible. Now real engines‚Äô efficiencies aren‚Äôt independent of speed and air density. As a plane gets lighter by burning fuel, our cartoon says its optimal speed at a given density would reduce (<em>v</em><sup>2</sup> ~ <em>mg</em>/(<em>œÅ</em>(<em>c</em><sub>d</sub><em>A</em><sub>p</sub><em>A</em><sub>s</sub>)<sup>1/2</sup>)). So a plane travelling in air of constant density should slow down a little as it gets lighter. But a plane can both keep going at a <em>constant speed</em> and continue flying at its <em>optimal</em> speed if it increases its altitude so as to reduce the air density. Next time you‚Äôre on a long-distance flight, you could check whether the pilot increases the cruising height from, say, 31 000 feet to 39 000 feet by the end of the flight.</p><h3 id="how-would-a-hydrogen-plane-perform">How would a hydrogen plane perform?</h3><p>We‚Äôve already argued that the efficiency of flight, in terms of energy per ton-km, is just a simple dimensionless number times <em>g</em>.

It would be more energy-efficient to fly shorter hops in shorter-range planes. The sweet spot is when the hops are about 5000 km long, so typical long-distance journeys would have one or two refuelling stops (Green, 2006). Multi-stage long-distance flying might be about 15% more fuel-efficient; but of course it would introduce other costs.</p><h3 id="eco-friendly-aeroplanes">Eco-friendly aeroplanes</h3><p>Occasionally you may hear about people making eco-friendly aeroplanes. Earlier in this chapter, however, our cartoon made the assertion that the transport cost of <em>any</em> plane is about</p><p>0.4¬†kWh/ton-km.</p><p>According to the cartoon, the only ways in which a plane could significantly improve on this figure are to reduce air resistance (perhaps by some new-fangled vacuum-cleaners-in-the-wings trick) or to change the geometry of the plane (making it look more like a glider, with immensely wide wings compared to the fuselage, or getting rid of the fuselage altogether).</p><p>So, let‚Äôs look at the latest news story about &quot;eco-friendly aviation&quot; and see whether one of these planes can beat the 0.4¬†kWh per ton-km benchmark.

An airship, blimp, zeppelin, or dirigible uses an enormous helium-filled balloon, which is lighter than air, to counteract the weight of its little cabin. The disadvantage of this strategy is that the enormous balloon greatly increases the air resistance of the vehicle.</p><p>The way to keep the energy cost of an airship (per weight, per distance) low is to move slowly, to be fish-shaped, and to be very large and long.

You can demonstrate the ground effect by flicking a piece of card across a flat table. Maintaining this air-cushion requires very little energy, so the ground-effect aircraft, in energy terms, is a lot like a surface vehicle with no rolling resistance. Its main energy expenditure is associated with air resistance.

In a sunny spot in America, in ponds fed with concentrated CO<sub>2</sub> (concentrated to 10%), Ron Putt of Auburn University says that algae can grow at 30 g per square metre per day, producing 0.01 litres of biodiesel per square metre per day. <a class="jsx-1614200154 " href="/sewtha#chapD.xhtml#chDn07"><span class="darkred">[<!-- -->7<!-- -->]</span></a> This corresponds to a power per unit pond area of <span class="green">4 W/m<sup>2</sup></span> ‚Äì similar to the Bavaria photovoltaic farm. If you wanted to drive a typical car (doing 12 km per litre) a distance of 50 km per day, then you‚Äôd need <span>420 square metres</span> of algae-ponds just to power your car; for comparison, the area of the UK per person is 4000 square metres, of which 69¬†m<sup>2</sup> is water (figure 6.8). Please don‚Äôt forget that it‚Äôs essential to feed these ponds with concentrated carbon dioxide. So this technology would be limited both by land area ‚Äì how much of the UK we could turn into algal ponds ‚Äì and by the availability of concentrated CO<sub>2</sub>, the capture of which would have an energy cost (a topic discussed in Chapters 23 and 31). Let‚Äôs check the limit imposed by the concentrated CO<sub>2</sub>. To grow 30 g of algae per m<sup>2</sup> per day would require at least 60 g of CO<sub>2</sub> per m<sup>2</sup> per day (because the CO<sub>2</sub> molecule has more mass per carbon atom than the molecules in algae). If all the CO<sub>2</sub> from all UK power stations were captured (roughly 2<sup>1</sup>‚ÅÑ<sub>2</sub> tons per year per person), it could service <span>230 square metres</span> per person of the algal ponds described above ‚Äì roughly 6% of the country. This area would deliver biodiesel with a power of 24¬†kWh per day per person, assuming that the numbers for sunny America apply here. A plausible vision? Perhaps on one tenth of that scale? I‚Äôll leave it to you to decide.</p><h3 id="what-about-algae-in-the-sea">What about algae in the sea?</h3><p>Remember what I just said: the algae-to-biodiesel posse always feed their algae concentrated CO<sub>2</sub>. If you‚Äôre going out to sea, presumably pumping CO<sub>2</sub> into it won‚Äôt be an option. And without the concentrated CO<sub>2</sub>, the productivity of algae drops 100-fold. For algae in the sea to make a difference, a country-sized harvesting area in the sea would be required.</p><h3 id="what-about-algae-that-produce-hydrogen">What about algae that produce hydrogen?</h3><p>Trying to get slime to produce hydrogen in sunlight is a smart idea because it cuts out a load of chemical steps normally performed by carbohydrate-producing plants. Every chemical step reduces efficiency a little. Hydrogen can be produced directly by the photosynthetic system, right at step one. A research study from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory in Colorado predicted that a reactor filled with genetically-modified green algae, covering an area of 11 hectares in the Arizona desert, could produce 300 kg of hydrogen per day. <a class="jsx-1614200154 " href="/sewtha#chapD.xhtml#chDn08"><span class="darkred">[<!-- -->8<!-- -->]</span></a> Hydrogen contains 39¬†kWh per kg, so this algae-to-hydrogen facility would deliver a power per unit area of 4.4 W/m<sup>2</sup>. Taking into account the estimated electricity required to run the facility, the net power delivered would be reduced to <span class="green">3.6 W/m<sup>2</sup></span>. That strikes me as still quite a promising number ‚Äì compare it with the Bavarian solar photovoltaic farm, for example (<span class="green">5 W/m<sup>2</sup></span>).</p><h2 id="food-for-humans-or-other-animals">Food for humans or other animals</h2><p>Grain crops such as wheat, oats, barley, and corn have an energy density of about 4¬†kWh per kg. In the UK, wheat yields of 7.7 tons per hectare per year are typical. If the wheat is eaten by an animal, the power per unit area of this process is 0.34 W/m<sup>2</sup>. If 2800¬†m<sup>2</sup> per person of Britain (that‚Äôs all agricultural land) were devoted to the growth of crops like these, the chemical energy generated would be about <span class="green">24¬†kWh/d per person</span>.</p><h2 id="incineration-of-agricultural-by-products">Incineration of agricultural by-products</h2><p>We found a moment ago that the power per unit area of a biomass power station burning the best energy crops is 0.2 W/m<sup>2</sup>. If instead we grow crops for food, and put the left-overs that we don‚Äôt eat into a power station ‚Äì or if we feed the food to chickens and put the left-overs that come out of the chickens‚Äô back ends into a power station ‚Äì what power could be delivered per unit area of farmland? Let‚Äôs make a rough guess, then take a look at some real data. For a wild guess, let‚Äôs imagine that by-products are harvested from half of the area of Britain (2000¬†m<sup>2</sup> per person) and trucked to power stations, and that general agricultural by-products deliver 10% as much power per unit area as the best energy crops: 0.02 W/m<sup>2</sup>. Multiplying this by 2000¬†m<sup>2</sup> we get <span class="green">1¬†kWh per day per person</span>.</p><p>Have I been unfair to agricultural garbage in making this wild guess? We can re-estimate the plausible production from agricultural left-overs by scaling up the prototype straw-burning power station at Elean in East Anglia. <a class="jsx-1614200154 " href="/sewtha#chapD.xhtml#chDn09"><span class="darkred">[<!-- -->9<!-- -->]</span></a> Elean‚Äôs power output is 36 MW, and it uses 200 000 tons per year from land located within a 50-mile radius. If we assume this density can be replicated across the whole country, the Elean model offers 0.002 W/m<sup>2</sup>. At 4000¬†m<sup>2</sup> per person, that‚Äôs 8 W per person, or <span class="green">0.2¬†kWh/day per person</span>.</p><p>Let‚Äôs calculate this another way. UK straw production is 10¬†million tons per year, or 0.46 kg per day per person. At 4.2¬†kWh per kg, this straw has a chemical energy of 2¬†kWh per day per person. If all the straw were burned in 30%-efficient power stations ‚Äì a proposal that wouldn‚Äôt go down well with farm animals, who have other uses for straw ‚Äì the electricity generated would be <span class="green">0.6¬†kWh/d per person</span>.</p><h3 id="landfill-methane-gas">Landfill methane gas</h3><p>At present, much of the methane gas leaking out of rubbish tips comes from biological materials, especially waste food. So, as long as we keep throwing away things like food and newspapers, landfill gas is a sustainable energy source ‚Äì plus, burning that methane might be a good idea from a climate-change perspective, since methane is a stronger greenhouse-gas than CO<sub>2</sub>. A landfill site receiving 7.5¬†million tons of household waste per year can generate 50 000¬†m<sup>3</sup> per hour of methane.</p><p>In 1994, landfill methane emissions were estimated to be 0.05¬†m<sup>3</sup> per person per day, which has a chemical energy of 0.5¬†kWh/d per person, and would generate <span class="green">0.2¬†kWh(e)/d per person</span>, if it were all converted to electricity with 40% efficiency.

The calorific value of the waste is 2.5¬†kWh/kg, and the thermal efficiency of the power station is about 21%, so each 1 kg of waste gets turned into 0.5¬†kWh of electricity. The carbon emissions are about 1000 g CO<sub>2</sub> per kWh.

In these units, the temperature demand is just the average of the temperature difference between inside and outside.<p>There is a third factor we must also discuss. The lost energy is replenished by the building‚Äôs heating system, and by other sources of energy such as the occupants, their gadgets, their cookers, and the sun. Focussing on the heating system, the energy <em>delivered</em> by the heating is not the same as the energy <em>consumed</em> by the heating.

(A fourth option ‚Äì increasing the building‚Äôs incidental heat gains, especially from the sun ‚Äì may also be useful, but I won‚Äôt address it here.)</p><h3 id="temperature-demand">Temperature demand</h3><p>We can visualize the temperature demand nicely on a graph of external temperature versus time (figure E.4). For a building held at a temperature of 20 ¬∞C, the total temperature demand is the <em>area</em> between the horizontal line at 20 ¬∞C and the external temperature. In figure E.4a, we see that, for one year in Cambridge, holding the temperature at 20 ¬∞C year-round had a temperature demand of 3188 degree-days of heating and 91 degree-days of cooling. These pictures allow us easily to assess the effect of turning down the thermostat and living without air-conditioning. Turning the winter thermostat down to 17 ¬∞C, the temperature demand for heating drops from 3188 degree-days to 2265 degree-days (figure E.4b), which corresponds to a 30% reduction in heating demand. Turning the thermostat down to 15 ¬∞C reduces the temperature demand from 3188 to 1748 degree days, a 45% reduction.</p><p>These calculations give us a ballpark indication of the benefit of turning down thermostats, but will give an exact prediction only if we take into account two details: first, buildings naturally absorb energy from the sun, boosting the inside above the outside temperature, even without any heating; and second, the occupants and their gadget companions emit heat, so further cutting down the artificial heating requirements. The temperature demand of a location, as conventionally expressed in degree-days, is a bit of an unwieldy thing. I find it hard to remember numbers like &quot;3500 degree-days.&quot; And academics may find the degree-day a distressing unit, since they already have another meaning for degree days (one involving dressing up in gowns and mortar boards). We can make this quantity more meaningful and perhaps easier to work with by dividing it by 365, the number of days in the year, obtaining the temperature demand in &quot;degree-days per day,&quot; or, if you prefer, in plain &quot;degrees.&quot; Figure E.6 shows this replotted temperature demand.

I‚Äôve treated the central wall of the semi-detached house as a perfect insulating wall, but this may be wrong if the gap between the adjacent houses is actually well-ventilated. I‚Äôve highlighted the parameters that I altered after 2006, in modifications to be described shortly.<p>To compare the leakinesses of two buildings that have different floor areas, we can divide the leakiness by the floor area; this gives the <em>heat-loss parameter</em> of the building, which is measured in W/¬∞C/m<sup>2</sup>. The heat-loss parameter of this house (total floor area 88¬†m<sup>2</sup>) is</p><p>3.7 W/¬∞C/m<sup>2</sup>.</p><p>Let‚Äôs use these figures to estimate the house‚Äôs daily energy consumption on a cold winter‚Äôs day, and year-round.</p><p>On a cold day, assuming an external temperature of -1 ¬∞C and an internal temperature of 19 ¬∞C, the temperature difference is Œî<em>T</em> = 20 ¬∞C.

The average rate of heat loss, if the house is always held at 19 ¬∞C, is therefore:</p><p>7.7¬†kWh/d/¬∞C √ó 2866 degree-days/y/(365 days/y) = 61¬†kWh/d.</p><p>Turning the thermostat down to 17 ¬∞C, the average rate of heat loss drops to 48¬†kWh/d.

The glazing modifications (new U-value 1.6‚Äì1.8) should reduce the conductive leakiness by 23 W/¬∞C, and the ventilation leakiness by something like 24 W/¬∞C.

The answer is yes, but there may be two complications. First, the thickness of internal covering is bigger than you might expect. To transform an existing nine-inch solid brick wall (U-value 2.2 W/m<sup>2</sup>/K) into a decent 0.30 W/m<sup>2</sup>/K wall, roughly 6 cm of insulated lining board is required. <!-- -->[<a class="jsx-1614200154 " href="http://tinyurl.com/65h3cb"><span class="websitetitle">65h3cb</span></a>]<!-- --> Second, condensation may form on the hidden surface of such internal insulation layers, leading to damp problems.</p><p>If you‚Äôre not looking for such a big reduction in wall leakiness, you can get by with a thinner internal covering. For example, you can buy 1.8-cmthick insulated wallboards with a U-value of 1.7 W/m<sup>2</sup>/K. With these over the existing wall, the U-value would be reduced from 2.2 W/m<sup>2</sup>/K to:</p><p>[<!-- -->\left. 1/{\left( {\frac{1}{2.2} + \frac{1}{1.7}} \right) \approx 1\text{~W/}\text{m}^{\text{2}}\text{/K.}} \right.<!-- -->]</p><p>Definitely a worthwhile reduction.</p><h2 id="air-exchange">Air-exchange</h2><p>Once a building is really well insulated, the principal loss of heat will be through ventilation (air changes) rather than through conduction. The heat loss through ventilation can be reduced by transferring the heat from the outgoing air to the incoming air. Remarkably, a great deal of this heat can indeed be transferred without any additional energy being required. The trick is to use a nose, as discovered by natural selection. A nose warms incoming air by cooling down outgoing air. There‚Äôs a temperature gradient along the nose; the walls of a nose are coldest near the nostrils. The longer your nose, the better it works as a counter-current heat exchanger. In nature‚Äôs noses, the direction of the air-flow usually alternates. Another way to organize a nose is to have two air-passages, one for in-flow and one for out-flow, separate from the point of view of air, but tightly coupled with each other so that heat can easily flow between the two passages. This is how the noses work in buildings. It‚Äôs conventional to call these noses heat-exchangers.</p><h2 id="an-energy-efficient-house">An energy-efficient house</h2><p><img src="/img/sewtha/figure292.gif"/></p><span class="figurenumber">Figure E.10.</span> The Heatkeeper Serrekunda.<p>In 1984, an energy consultant, Alan Foster, built an energy-efficient house near Cambridge; he kindly gave me his thorough measurements. The house is a timber-framed bungalow based on a Scandinavian &quot;Heatkeeper Serrekunda&quot; design (figure E.10), with a floor area of 140¬†m<sup>2</sup>, composed of three bedrooms, a study, two bathrooms, a living room, a kitchen, and a lobby. The wooden outside walls were supplied in kit form by a Scottish company, and the main parts of the house took only a few days to build.</p><p>The walls are 30 cm thick and have a U-value of 0.28 W/m<sup>2</sup>/¬∞C. From the inside out, they consist of 13¬†mm of plasterboard, 27¬†mm airspace, a vapour barrier, 8¬†mm of plywood, 90¬†mm of rockwool, 12¬†mm of bitumen-impregnated fibreboard, 50¬†mm cavity, and 103¬†mm of brick. The ceiling construction is similar with 100‚Äì200¬†mm of rockwool insulation. The ceiling has a U-value of 0.27 W/m<sup>2</sup>/¬∞C, and the floor, 0.22 W/m<sup>2</sup>/¬∞C. The windows are double-glazed (U-value 2 W/m<sup>2</sup>/¬∞C), with the inner panes‚Äô outer surfaces specially coated to reduce radiation. The windows are arranged to give substantial solar gain, contributing about 30% of the house‚Äôs space-heating.</p><p><img src="/img/sewtha/figure293.gif"/></p><span class="figurenumber">Figure E.11.</span> The Heatkeeper‚Äôs heat-exchanger.<p>The house is well sealed, every door and window lined with neoprene gaskets. The house is heated by warm air pumped through floor grilles; in winter, pumps remove used air from several rooms, exhausting it to the outside, and they take in air from the loft space. The incoming air and outgoing air pass through a heat exchanger (figure E.11), which saves 60% of the heat in the extracted air. The heat exchanger is a passive device, using no energy: it‚Äôs like a big metal nose, warming the incoming air with the outgoing air. On a cold winter‚Äôs day, the outside air temperature was -8 ¬∞C, the temperature in the loft‚Äôs air intake was 0 ¬∞C, and the air coming out of the heat exchanger was at +8 ¬∞C.</p><p>For the first decade, the heat was supplied entirely by electric heaters, heating a 150-gallon heat store during the overnight economy period. More recently a gas supply was brought to the house, and the space heating is now obtained from a condensing boiler.</p><p>The heat loss through conduction and ventilation is 4.2¬†kWh/d/¬∞C.

But it can be significantly improved upon, by heat pumps. Whereas the condensing boiler takes chemical energy and turns 90% of it into useful heat, the heat pump takes some electrical energy and uses it to <em>move</em> heat from one place to another (for example, from outside a building to inside). Usually the amount of useful heat delivered is much bigger than the amount of electricity used.

If the flux we want to suck out of the ground in winter is much bigger than these natural fluxes then we know that our sucking is going to significantly alter ground temperatures, and may thus not be feasible. For this calculation, I‚Äôll assume the ground just below the surface is held, by the combined influence of sun, air, cloud, and night sky, at a temperature that varies slowly up and down during the year (figure E.16).</p><p><img src="/img/sewtha/figure295.gif"/></p><span class="figurenumber">Figure E.16.</span> The temperature in Cambridge, 2006, and a cartoon, which says the temperature is the sum of an annual sinusoidal variation between 3 ¬∞C and 20 ¬∞C, and a daily sinusoidal variation with range up to 10.3 ¬∞C.

This diagram shows the answer for any material in terms of the <em>characteristic length-scale</em> <em>z</em><span class="smallfont1"><sub>0</sub></span> (equation (E.7)), which depends on the conductivity <em>Œ∫</em> and heat capacity <em>C</em><span class="smallfont1"><sub>V</sub></span> of the material, and on the frequency <em>œâ</em> of the external temperature variations. (We can choose to look at either daily and yearly variations using the same theory.) At a depth of 2<em>z</em><span class="smallfont1"><sub>0</sub></span>, the variations in temperature are one seventh of those at the surface, and lag them by about one third of a cycle (figure E.17). At a depth of 3<em>z</em><span class="smallfont1"><sub>0</sub></span>, the variations in temperature are one twentieth of those at the surface, and lag them by half a cycle.</p><p>For the case of daily variations and solid granite, the characteristic length-scale is <em>z</em><span class="smallfont1"><sub>0</sub></span> = 0.16¬†m. (So 32 cm of rock is the thickness you need to ride out external daily temperature oscillations.) For yearly variations and solid granite, the characteristic length-scale is <em>z</em><span class="smallfont1"><sub>0</sub></span> = 3¬†m.</p><p>Let‚Äôs focus on annual variations and discuss a few other materials. Characteristic length-scales for various materials are in the third column of table E.18. For damp sandy soils or concrete, the characteristic length-scale <em>z</em><span class="smallfont1"><sub>0</sub></span> is similar to that of granite ‚Äì about 2.6¬†m. In dry or peaty soils, the length-scale <em>z</em><span class="smallfont1"><sub>0</sub></span> is shorter ‚Äì about 1.3¬†m. That‚Äôs perhaps good news because it means you don‚Äôt have to dig so deep to find ground with a stable temperature. But it‚Äôs also coupled with some bad news: the natural fluxes are smaller in dry soils.</p><p>The natural flux varies during the year and has a peak value (equation (E.9)) that is smaller, the smaller the conductivity.</p><p>For the case of solid granite, the peak flux is 8 W/m<sup>2</sup>. For dry soils, the peak flux ranges from 0.7 W/m<sup>2</sup> to 2.3 W/m<sup>2</sup>. For damp soils, the peak flux ranges from 3 W/m<sup>2</sup> to 8 W/m<sup>2</sup>.</p><p>What does this mean? I suggest we take a flux in the middle of these numbers, 5 W/m<sup>2</sup>, as a useful benchmark, giving guidance about what sort of power we could expect to extract, per unit area, with a ground-source heat pump. If we suck a flux significantly smaller than 5 W/m<sup>2</sup>, the perturbation we introduce to the natural flows will be small. If on the other hand we try to suck a flux bigger than 5 W/m<sup>2</sup>, we should expect that we‚Äôll be shifting the temperature of the ground significantly away from its natural value, and such fluxes may be impossible to demand.</p><p>The population density of a typical English suburb corresponds to 160¬†m<sup>2</sup> per person (rows of semi-detached houses with about 400¬†m<sup>2</sup> per house, including pavements and streets).

It depends. The outdoor temperature can vary during the day by about 10 ¬∞C. A building with large thermal mass ‚Äì thick stone walls, for example ‚Äì will naturally ride out those variations in temperature, and, without heating or cooling, will have a temperature close to the average outdoor temperature. Such buildings, in the UK, need neither heating nor cooling for many months of the year. In contrast, a poorly-insulated building with low thermal mass might be judged too hot during the day and too cool at night, leading to greater expenditure on cooling and heating.</p><p>However, large thermal mass is not always a boon. If a room is occupied in winter for just a couple of hours a day (think of a lecture room for example), the energy cost of warming the room up to a comfortable temperature will be greater, the greater the room‚Äôs thermal mass. This extra invested heat will linger for longer in a thermally massive room, but if nobody is there to enjoy it, it‚Äôs wasted heat. So in the case of infrequently-used rooms it makes sense to aim for a structure with low thermal mass, and to warm that small mass rapidly when required.</p><h2 id="notes-and-further-reading-31">Notes and further reading</h2><p><a class="jsx-1614200154 " href="/sewtha#chapE.xhtml#ret01"><span class="mark">[<!-- -->1<!-- -->]</span></a><em>Table E.18.</em> Sources: Bonan (2002), <a class="jsx-1614200154 " href="http://www.hukseflux.com/thermalScience/thermalConductivity.html"><span class="websitetitle">www.hukseflux.com/thermalScience/thermalConductivity.html</span></a></p><p>If we assume the ground is made of solid homogenous material with conductivity <em>Œ∫</em> and heat capacity <em>C</em><sub>V</sub>, then the temperature at depth <em>z</em> below the ground and time <em>t</em> responds to the imposed temperature at the surface in accordance with the diffusion equation</p><p>[<!-- -->\begin{matrix}

The potential energy is the energy required to move all the water from the troughs to the crests. The kinetic energy is associated with the water moving around.</p><p>People sometimes assume that when the crest of a wave moves across an ocean at 30miles per hour, the water in that crest must also be moving at 30miles per hour in the same direction. But this isn‚Äôt so. It‚Äôs just like a Mexican wave. When the wave rushes round the stadium, the humans who are making the wave aren‚Äôt themselves moving round the stadium: they just bob up and down a little. The motion of a piece of water in the ocean is similar: if you focused on a bit of seaweed floating in the water as waves go by, you‚Äôd see that the seaweed moves up and down, and also a little to and fro in the direction of travel of the wave ‚Äì the exact effect could be recreated in a Mexican wave if people moved like window-cleaners, polishing a big piece of glass in a circular motion. The wave has potential energy because of the elevation of the crests above the troughs. And it has kinetic energy because of the small circular bobbing motion of the water.</p><p>Our rough calculation of the power in ocean waves will require three ingredients: an estimate of the period <em>T</em> of the waves (the time between crests), an estimate of the height <em>h</em> of the waves, and a physics formula that tells us how to work out the speed <em>v</em> of the wave from its period.</p><p>The wavelength <em>Œª</em> and period of the waves (the distance and time respectively between two adjacent crests) depend on the speed of the wind that creates the waves, as shown in figure F.1. The height of the waves doesn‚Äôt depend on the windspeed; rather, it depends on how long the wind has been caressing the water surface.</p><p>You can estimate the period of ocean waves by recalling the time between waves arriving on an ocean beach. Is 10 seconds reasonable? For the height of ocean waves, let‚Äôs assume an amplitude of 1¬†m, which means 2¬†m from trough to crest. In waves this high, a man in a dinghy can‚Äôt see beyond the nearest crest when he‚Äôs in a trough; I think this height is bigger than average, but we can revisit this estimate if we decide it‚Äôs important. The speed of deep-water waves is related to the time <em>T</em> between crests by the physics formula (see Faber (1995), p170):</p><p>[<!-- -->v = \frac{gT}{2\pi}\text{,}<!-- -->]</p><p>where <em>g</em> is the acceleration of gravity (9.8¬†m/s<sup>2</sup>). For example, if <em>T</em> = 10 seconds, then <em>v</em> = 16¬†m/s.

Just like a deep-water wave, the wave has energy in two forms: potential energy associated with raising water out of the light-shaded troughs into the heavy-shaded crests; and kinetic energy of all the water moving around as indicated by the small arrows. The speed of the wave, travelling from left to right, is indicated by the much bigger arrow at the top. For tidal waves, a typical depth might be 100¬†m, the crest velocity 30¬†m/s, the vertical amplitude at the surface 1 or 2¬†m, and the water velocity amplitude 0.3 or 0.6¬†m/s.<p>The energy we can extract from tides, using tidal pools or tide farms, can never be more than the energy of these tidal waves from the Atlantic. We can estimate the total power of these great Atlantic tidal waves in the same way that we estimate the power of ordinary wind-generated waves. The next section describes a standard model for the power arriving in travelling waves in water of depth <em>d</em> that is shallow compared to the wavelength of the waves (figure G.2).

These figures are impressive compared with the raw power per unit length of ordinary Atlantic deep water waves, 40¬†kW/m (Chapter F).

Since then, experimental measurements and computer models have verified and extended Taylor‚Äôs analysis. Flather (1976) built a detailed numerical model of the lunar tide, chopping the continental shelf around the British Isles into roughly 1000 square cells. Flather estimated that the total average power entering this region is 215 GW. According to his model, 180 GW enters the gap between France and Ireland. From Northern Ireland round to Shetland, the incoming power is 49 GW. Between Shetland and Norway there is a net loss of 5 GW. As shown in figure G.4, Cartwright et al. (1980) found experimentally that the average power transmission was 60 GW between Malin Head (Ireland) and Flor√∏ (Norway) and 190 GW between Valentia (Ireland) and the Brittany coast near Ouessant.

I‚Äôm going to go into this model of tidal power in some detail because most of the official estimates of the UK tidal resource have been based on a model that I believe is incorrect.</p><p>Figure G.2 shows a model for a tidal wave travelling across relatively shallow water. This model is intended as a cartoon, for example, of tidal crests moving up the English channel or down the North Sea. It‚Äôs important to distinguish the speed <em>U</em> at which the water itself moves (which might be about 1¬†mile per hour) from the speed v at which the high tide moves, which is typically 100 or 200¬†miles per hour.</p><p>The water has depth <em>d</em>. Crests and troughs of water are injected from the left hand side by the 12-hourly ocean tides. The crests and troughs move with velocity</p><p>[<!-- -->\begin{matrix}

Call the vertical amplitude of the tide <em>h</em>. For the standard assumption of nearly-vorticity-free flow, the horizontal velocity of the water is near-constant with depth. The horizontal velocity <em>U</em> is proportional to the surface displacement and can be found by conservation of mass:</p><p>[<!-- -->\begin{matrix}
{U = {vh/d}} <!-- -->\<!-- -->
\end{matrix}\text{.}<!-- -->]</p><p>If the depth decreases, the wave velocity <em>v</em> reduces (equation (G.2)). For the present discussion we‚Äôll assume the depth is constant. Energy flows from left to right at some rate. How should this total tidal power be estimated? And what‚Äôs the <em>maximum</em> power that could be extracted?</p><p>One suggestion is to choose a cross-section and estimate the average <em>flux of kinetic energy</em> across that plane, then assert that this quantity represents the power that could be extracted. This kinetic-energy-flux method was used by consultants Black and Veatch to estimate the UK resource. In our cartoon model, we can compute the total power by other means. We‚Äôll see that the kinetic-energy-flux answer is too small by a significant factor.</p><p>The peak kinetic-energy flux at any section is</p><p>[<!-- -->\begin{matrix}

(This is the formula for kinetic energy flux, which we encountered in Chapter B.)</p><p>The true total incident power is not equal to this kinetic-energy flux. The true total incident power in a shallow-water wave is a standard textbook calculation; one way to get it is to find the total energy present in one wavelength and divide by the period. The total energy per wavelength is the sum of the potential energy and the kinetic energy. The kinetic energy happens to be identical to the potential energy. (This is a standard feature of almost all things that wobble, be they masses on springs or children on swings.) So to compute the total energy all we need to do is compute one of the two ‚Äì the potential energy per wavelength, or the kinetic energy per wavelength ‚Äì then double it. The potential energy of a wave (per wavelength and per unit width of wavefront) is found by integration to be</p><p>[<!-- -->\begin{matrix}

Strikingly, the two expressions scale differently with the amplitude <em>h</em>.

The Coriolis force causes tidal crests and troughs to tend to drive on the right ‚Äì for example, going up the English Channel, the high tides are higher and the low tides are lower on the French side of the channel. By neglecting this effect I may have introduced some error into the estimates.</p><h2 id="power-density-of-tidal-stream-farms">Power density of tidal stream farms</h2><p>Imagine sticking underwater windmills on the sea-bed. The flow of water will turn the windmills. Because the density of water is roughly 1000 times that of air, the power of water flow is 1000 times greater than the power of wind at the same speed.</p><p>What power could tidal stream farms extract? It depends crucially on whether or not we can add up the power contributions of tidefarms on <em>adjacent</em> pieces of sea-floor. For wind, this additivity assumption is believed to work fine: as long as the wind turbines are spaced a standard distance apart from each other, the total power delivered by 10 adjacent wind farms is the sum of the powers that each would deliver if it were alone.</p><p>Does the same go for tide farms? Or do underwater windmills interfere with each other‚Äôs power extraction in a different way? I don‚Äôt think the answer to this question is known in general. We can name two alternative assumptions, however, and identify cartoon situations in which each assumption seems valid. The &quot;tide is like wind&quot; assumption says that you can put tide-turbines all over the sea-bed, spaced about 5 diameters apart from each other, and they won‚Äôt interfere with each other, no matter how much of the sea-bed you cover with such tide farms.</p><p>The &quot;you can have only one row&quot; assumption, in contrast, asserts that the maximum power extractable in a region is the power that would be delivered by a <em>single</em> row of turbines facing the flow. A situation where this assumption is correct is the special case of a hydroelectric dam: if the water from the dam passes through a single well-designed turbine, there‚Äôs no point putting any more turbines behind that one. You can‚Äôt get 100 times more power by putting 99¬†more turbines downstream from the first. The oomph gets extracted by the first one, and there isn‚Äôt any more oomph left for the others. The &quot;you can have only one row&quot; assumption is the right assumption for estimating the extractable power in a place where water flows through a narrow channel from approximately stationary water at one height into another body of water at a lower height. (This case is analysed by Garrett and Cummins (2005, 2007).)</p><p>I‚Äôm now going to nail my colours to a mast. I think that in many places round the British Isles, the &quot;tide is like wind&quot; assumption is a good approximation. Perhaps some spots have some of the character of a narrow channel. In those spots, my estimates may be over-estimates.</p><p>Let‚Äôs assume that the rules for laying out a sensible tide farm will be similar to those for wind farms, and that the efficiency of the tidemills will be like that of the best windmills, about 1/2.

Tidal charts usually give the currents associated with the tides with the largest range (called spring tides) and the tides with the smallest range (called neap tides). Spring tides occur shortly after each full moon and each new moon. Neap tides occur shortly after the first and third quarters of the moon. The power of a tide farm would vary throughout the day in a completely predictable manner. Figure G.5 illustrates the variation of power density of a tide farm with a maximum current of 1.5¬†m/s. The average power density of this tide farm would be 6.4 W/m<sup>2</sup>. There are many places around the British Isles where the power per unit area of tide farm would be 6 W/m<sup>2</sup> or more.

A coating of turbines placed just above the sea floor could act as a substitute bottom, exerting roughly the same drag on the passing water as the sea floor used to exert, and extracting roughly the same amount of power as friction used to dissipate, without significantly altering the tidal flows.</p><p>So, what‚Äôs the power dissipated by &quot;bottom friction&quot;? Unfortunately, there isn‚Äôt a straightforward model of bottom friction. It depends on the roughness of the sea bed and the material that the bed is made from ‚Äì and even given this information, the correct formula to use is not settled. One widely used model says that the magnitude of the stress (force per unit area) is <!-- -->(<!-- -->R<em>{1}\rho U^{2}\text{,}<!-- -->)<!-- --> where <em>U</em> is the average flow velocity and <!-- -->(<!-- -->R</em>{1}<!-- -->)<!-- --> is a dimensionless quantity called the shear friction coefficient. We can estimate the power dissipated per unit area by multiplying the stress by the velocity. Table G.9 shows the power dissipated in friction, <!-- -->(<!-- -->R<em>{1}\rho U^{3}\text{,}<!-- -->)<!-- --> assuming <!-- -->(<!-- -->R</em>{1} = 0.01<!-- -->)<!-- --> or <!-- -->(<!-- -->R_{1} = 0.003\text{.}<!-- -->)<!-- --> For values of the shear friction coefficient in this range, the friction power is very similar to the estimated power that a tide farm would deliver. This is good news, because it suggests that planting a forest of underwater windmills on the sea-bottom, spaced five diameters apart, won‚Äôt radically alter the flow. The natural friction already has an effect that is in the same ballpark.</p><h2 id="tidal-pools-with-pumping">Tidal pools with pumping</h2><p>&quot;The pumping trick&quot; artificially increases the amplitude of the tides in a tidal pool so as to amplify the power obtained. The energy cost of pumping <em>in</em> extra water at high tide is repaid with interest when the same water is let out at low tide; similarly, extra water can be pumped <em>out</em> at low tide, then let back in at high tide. The pumping trick is sometimes used at La Rance, boosting its net power generation by about 10% (Wilson and Balls, 1990). Let‚Äôs work out the theoretical limit for this technology. I‚Äôll assume that generation has an efficiency of <!-- -->(<!-- -->\varepsilon<em>{\text{g}} = 0.9<!-- -->)<!-- --> and that pumping has an efficiency of <!-- -->(<!-- -->\varepsilon</em>{\text{p}} = 0.85\text{.}<!-- -->)<!-- --> Let the tidal range be 2<em>h</em>. I‚Äôll assume for simplicity that the prices of buying and selling electricity are the same at all times, so that the optimal height boost <em>b</em> to which the pool is pumped above high water is given by (marginal cost of extra pumping = marginal return of extra water):</p><p>[<!-- -->b/\varepsilon<em>{\text{p}} = \varepsilon</em>{\text{g}}\left( {b + 2h} \right)\text{.}<!-- -->]</p><p>Defining the round-trip efficiency <!-- -->(<!-- -->\varepsilon = \varepsilon<em>{\text{g}}\varepsilon</em>{\text{p}}\text{,}<!-- -->)<!-- --> we have</p><p>[<!-- -->b = 2h\frac{\varepsilon}{1 - \varepsilon}\text{.}<!-- -->]</p><p>For example, with a tidal range of 2<em>h</em> = 4¬†m, and a round-trip efficiency of <em>Œµ</em> = 76%, the optimal boost is <em>b</em> = 13¬†m. This is the maximum height to which pumping can be justified if the price of electricity is constant.</p><p>Let‚Äôs assume the complementary trick is used at low tide. (This requires the basin to have a vertical range of 30¬†m<!-- -->!<!-- -->) The delivered power per unit area is then</p><p>[<!-- -->\left. \left( {\frac{1}{2}\rho g\varepsilon<em>{\text{g}}\left( b + 2h \right)^{2} - \frac{1}{2}\rho g\frac{1}{\varepsilon</em>{\text{p}}}b^{2}} \right)/T \right.\text{,}<!-- -->]</p><p>where <em>T</em> is the time from high tide to low tide.

Table G.10 shows the theoretical power density that pumping could deliver. Unfortunately, this pumping trick will rarely be exploited to the full because of the economics of basin construction: full exploitation of pumping requires the total height of the pool to be roughly 4 times the tidal range, and increases the delivered power four-fold. But the amount of material in a sea-wall of height <em>H</em> scales as <em>H</em><sup>2</sup>, so the cost of constructing a wall four times as high will be more than four times as big. Extra cash would probably be better spent on enlarging a tidal pool horizontally rather than vertically.</p><table><thead><tr class="header"><th>tidal amplitude<br/>(half-range) <em>h<br/></em>(m)</th><th>optimal boost<br/>height <em>b<br/></em>(m)</th><th>power<br/>with pumping<br/>(W/m<sup>2</sup>)</th><th>power<br/>without pumping<br/>(W/m<sup>2</sup>)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr class="odd"><td>1.0</td><td>6.5</td><td>3.5</td><td>0.8</td></tr><tr class="even"><td>2.0</td><td>13</td><td>14</td><td>3.3</td></tr><tr class="odd"><td>3.0</td><td>20</td><td>31</td><td>7.4</td></tr><tr class="even"><td>4.0</td><td>26</td><td>56</td><td>13</td></tr></tbody></table><span class="figurenumber">Table G.10.</span> Theoretical power density from tidal power using the pumping trick, assuming no constraint on the height of the basin‚Äôs walls.<table><thead><tr class="header"><th>tidal amplitude<br/>(half-range) <em>h</em><br/>(m)</th><th>boost height<br/><em>b</em><br/>(m)</th><th>power<br/>with pumping<br/>(W/m<sup>2</sup>)</th><th>power<br/>without pumping<br/>(W/m<sup>2</sup>)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr class="odd"><td>1.0</td><td>1.0</td><td>1.6</td><td>0.8</td></tr><tr class="even"><td>2.0</td><td>2.0</td><td>6.3</td><td>3.3</td></tr><tr class="odd"><td>3.0</td><td>3.0</td><td>14</td><td>7.4</td></tr><tr class="even"><td>4.0</td><td>4.0</td><td>25</td><td>13</td></tr></tbody></table><span class="figurenumber">Table G.11.</span> Power density offered by the pumping trick, assuming the boost height is constrained to be the same as the tidal amplitude. This assumption applies, for example, at neap tides, if the pumping pushes the tidal range up to the springs range.<p>The pumping trick can nevertheless be used for free on any day when the range of natural tides is smaller than the maximum range: the water level at high tide can be pumped up to the maximum. Table G.11 gives the power delivered if the boost height is set to <em>h</em>, that is, the range in the pool is just double the external range. A doubling of vertical range is easy at neap tides, since neap tides are typically about half as high as spring tides. Pumping the pool at neaps so that the full springs range is used thus allows neap tides to deliver roughly twice as much power as they would offer without pumping. So a system with pumping would show two-weekly variations in power of just a factor of 2 instead of 4.</p><h3 id="getting-always-on-tidal-power-by-using-two-basins">Getting &quot;always-on&quot; tidal power by using two basins</h3><p>Here‚Äôs a neat idea: have two basins, one of which is the &quot;full&quot; basin and one the &quot;empty&quot; basin; every high tide, the full basin is topped up; every low tide, the empty basin is emptied. <a class="jsx-1614200154 " href="/sewtha#chapG.xhtml#chGn02"><span class="darkred">[<!-- -->2<!-- -->]</span></a> These toppings-up and emptyings could be done either passively through sluices, or actively by pumps (using the trick mentioned above). Whenever power is required, water is allowed to flow from the full basin to the empty basin, or (better in power terms) between one of the basins and the sea. The capital cost of a two-basin scheme may be bigger because of the need for extra walls; the big win is that power is available all the time, so the facility can follow demand.</p><p><img src="/img/sewtha/figure304.gif"/></p><span class="figurenumber">Figure G.12.</span> Different ways to use the tidal pumping trick. Two lagoons are located at sea-level. (a) One simple way of using two lagoons is to label one the high pool and the other the low pool; when the surrounding sea level is near to high tide, let water into the high pool, or actively pump it in (using electricity from other sources); and similarly, when the sea level is near to low tide, empty the low pool, either passively or by active pumping; then whenever power is sufficiently valuable, generate power on demand by letting water from the high pool to the low pool. (b) Another arrangement that might deliver more power per unit area has no flow of water between the two lagoons. While one lagoon is being pumped full or pumped empty, the other lagoon can deliver steady, demand-following power to the grid. Pumping may be powered by bursty sources such as wind, by spare power from the grid (say, nuclear power stations), or by the other half of the facility, using one lagoon‚Äôs power to pump the other lagoon up or down.<p>We can use power generated from the empty basin to pump extra water into the full basin at high tide, and similarly use power from the full basin to pump down the empty basin at low tide. This self-pumping would boost the total power delivered by the facility without ever needing to buy energy from the grid. It‚Äôs a delightful feature of a two-pool solution that the optimal time to <em>pump</em> water into the high pool is high tide, which is also the optimal time to <em>generate</em> power from the low pool. Similarly, low tide is the perfect time to pump down the low pool, and it‚Äôs the perfect time to generate power from the high pool. In a simple simulation, I‚Äôve found that a two-lagoon system in a location with a natural tidal range of 4¬†m can, with an appropriate pumping schedule, deliver a <em>steady</em> power of 4.5 W/m<sup>2</sup> (MacKay, 2007a). One lagoon‚Äôs water level is always kept above mean sea-level; the other lagoon‚Äôs level is always kept below mean sea-level. This power density of 4.5 W/m<sup>2</sup> is 50% bigger than the maximum possible average power density of an ordinary tide-pool in the same location (3 W/m<sup>2</sup>). The steady power of the lagoon system would be more valuable than the intermittent and less-flexible power from the ordinary tide-pool.</p><p>A two-basin system could also function as a pumped-storage facility.</p><h2 id="notes-2">Notes</h2><p><a class="jsx-1614200154 " href="/sewtha#chapG.xhtml#ret01"><span class="mark">[<!-- -->1<!-- -->]</span></a><em>Efficiency of 90%...</em> Turbines are about 90% efficient for heads of 3.7¬†m or more.

I‚Äôve figured out what some of them mean. I list them here, to help you translate the media stories you read.</p><h4 id="homes">Homes</h4><p>The &quot;home&quot; is commonly used when describing the power of renewable facilities. For example, &quot;The ¬£300¬†million Whitelee wind farm‚Äôs 140 turbines will generate 322 MW ‚Äì enough to power 200 000 homes.&quot; The &quot;home&quot; is defined by the BritishWind Energy Association to be a power of <span class="red">4700¬†kWh per year</span> <!-- -->[<a class="jsx-1614200154 " href="http://www.bwea.com/ukwed/operational.asp"><span class="websitetitle">www.bwea.com/ukwed/operational.asp</span></a>]<!-- -->. That‚Äôs 0.54¬†kW, or <span class="red">13¬†kWh per day</span>. (A few other organizations use 4000¬†kWh/y per household.)</p><p>The &quot;home&quot; annoys me because I worry that people confuse it with <em>the total power consumption of the occupants of a home</em> ‚Äì but the latter is actually about 24 times bigger. The &quot;home&quot; covers the average domestic <em>electricity</em> consumption of a household, only. Not the household‚Äôs home heating. Nor their workplace. Nor their transport. Nor all the energy-consuming things that society does for them.</p><p>Incidentally, when they talk of the CO<sub>2</sub> emissions of a &quot;home,&quot; the official exchange rate appears to be 4 tons CO<sub>2</sub> per home per year.</p><h4 id="power-stations">Power stations</h4><p>Energy saving ideas are sometimes described in terms of power stations. For example according to a BBC report on putting new everlasting LED lightbulbs in traffic lights, &quot;The power savings would be huge ‚Äì keeping the UK‚Äôs traffic lights running requires the equivalent of two mediumsized power stations.&quot; <a class="jsx-1614200154 " href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/low/sci/tech/specials/sheffield_99/449368.stm"><span class="websitetitle">news.bbc.co.uk/1/low/sci/tech/specials/ sheffield<!-- -->_<!-- -->99/449368.stm</span></a></p><p><img src="/img/sewtha/figure309-0-0.gif"/></p><span class="figurenumber">Figure I.2.</span> Powers of Britain‚Äôs coal power stations.

Richard Branson says that <em>if</em> Virgin Trains‚Äô Voyager fleet switched to 20% biodiesel ‚Äì I emphasize the &quot;if&quot; because people like Beardie are always getting media publicity for announcing that they are <em>thinking</em> of doing good things, but some of these fanfared initiatives are later quietly cancelled, such as the idea of towing aircraft around airports to make them greener ‚Äì sorry, I got distracted again. Richard Branson says that <em>if</em> Virgin Trains‚Äô Voyager fleet switched to 20% biodiesel, then there would be a reduction of 34 500 tons of CO<sub>2</sub> per year, which is equivalent to &quot;23 000 cars taken off the road.&quot; This statement reveals the exchange rate:</p><p>&quot;one car taken off the road&quot; ‚Üî - 1.5 tons per year of CO<sub>2</sub>.</p><h4 id="calories">Calories</h4><p>The calorie is annoying because the diet community call a kilocalorie a Calorie. 1 such food Calorie = 1000 calories.</p><p>2500 kcal = 3¬†kWh = 10 000 kJ = 10 MJ.</p><h4 id="barrels">Barrels</h4><p>An annoying unit loved by the oil community, along with the ton of oil. Why can‚Äôt they stick to one unit? A barrel of oil is 6.1 GJ or 1700¬†kWh.</p><p>Barrels are doubly annoying because there are multiple definitions of barrels, all having different volumes.</p><p>Here‚Äôs everything you need to know about barrels of oil. One barrel is 42 U.S. gallons, or 159 litres. One barrel of oil is 0.1364 tons of oil. One barrel of crude oil has an energy of 5.75 GJ. One barrel of oil weighs 136 kg. One ton of crude oil is 7.33 barrels and 42.1 GJ. The carbon-pollution rate of crude oil is 400 kg of CO<sub>2</sub> per barrel. <a class="jsx-1614200154 " href="http://www.chemlink.com.au/conversions.htm"><span class="websitetitle">www.chemlink.com.au/conversions.htm</span></a>. This means that when the price of oil is $100 per barrel, oil energy costs 6¬¢ per kWh. If there were a carbon tax of $250 per ton of CO<sub>2</sub> on fossil fuels, that tax would increase the price of a barrel of oil by $100.</p><h4 id="gallons">Gallons</h4><p>The gallon would be a fine human-friendly unit, except the Yanks messed it up by defining the gallon differently from everyone else, as they did the pint and the quart. The US volumes are all roughly five-sixths of the correct volumes.</p><p>1 US gal = 3.785 l = 0.83 imperial gal. 1 imperial gal = 4.545 l.</p><h4 id="tons">Tons</h4><p>Tons are annoying because there are short tons, long tons and metric tons. They are close enough that I don‚Äôt bother distinguishing between them. 1 short ton (2000 lb) = 907 kg; 1 long ton (2240 lb) = 1016 kg; 1¬†metric ton (or tonne) = 1000 kg.</p><h4 id="btu-and-quads">BTU and quads</h4><p>British thermal units are annoying because they are neither part of the <em>Syst√®me International</em>, nor are they of a useful size. Like the useless joule, they are too small, so you have to roll out silly prefixes like &quot;quadrillion&quot; (10<sup>15</sup>) to make practical use of them.</p><p>1 kJ is 0.947 BTU. 1¬†kWh is 3409 BTU.</p><p>A &quot;quad&quot; is 1 quadrillion BTU = 293 TWh.</p><h2 id="funny-units">Funny units</h2><h4 id="cups-of-tea">Cups of tea</h4><p>Is this a way to make solar panels sound good? &quot;Once all the 7 000 photovoltaic panels are in place, it is expected that the solar panels will create 180 000 units of renewable electricity each year ‚Äì enough energy to make nine million cups of tea.&quot; This announcement thus equates 1¬†kWh to 50 cups of tea.</p><p>As a unit of volume, 1 US cup (half a US pint) is officially 0.24 l; but a cup of tea or coffee is usually about 0.18 l.

First, he says &quot;carbon dioxide&quot; but gives numbers for carbon: the burning of fossil fuels sends <em>26</em> gigatonnes of CO<sub>2</sub> per year into the atmosphere (not 7 gigatonnes). A common mistake. Second, he claims that the oceans send 36000 gigatonnes of carbon per year into the atmosphere.

(1979). This report‚Äôs conclusions carry weight because the National Academy of Sciences (the US equivalent of the Royal Society) commissioned the report and selected its authors on the basis of their expertise, &quot;and with regard for appropriate balance.&quot; The study group was convened &quot;under the auspices of the Climate Research Board of the National Research Council to assess the scientiÔ¨Åc basis for projection of possible future climatic changes resulting from man-made releases of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.&quot; SpeciÔ¨Åcally, they were asked: &quot;to identify the principal premises on which our current understanding of the question is based, to assess quantitatively the adequacy and uncertainty of our knowledge of these factors and processes, and to summarize in concise and objective terms our best present understanding of the carbon dioxide/climate issue for the beneÔ¨Åt of policy-makers.&quot; The report is just 33 pages long, it is free to download <!-- -->[<a class="jsx-1614200154 " href="http://tinyurl.com/5qfkaw"><span class="websitetitle">5qfkaw</span></a>]<!-- -->, and I recommend it. It makes clear which bits of the science were already settled in 1979, and which bits still had uncertainty. Here are the main points I picked up from this report. First, doubling the atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> concentration would change the net heating of the troposphere, oceans, and land by an average power per unit area of roughly 4 W/m<sup>2</sup>, if all other properties of the atmosphere remained unchanged. This heating effect can be compared with the average power absorbed by the atmosphere, land, and oceans, which is 238 W/m<sup>2</sup>. So doubling CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations would have a warming effect equivalent to increasing the intensity of the sun by 4/238 = 1.7%. Second, the consequences of this CO<sub>2</sub>-induced heating are hard to predict, on account of the complexity of the atmosphere/ocean system, but the authors predicted a global surface warming of between 2¬∞C and 3.5¬∞C, with greater increases at high latitudes. Finally, the authors summarize: &quot;we have tried but have been unable to Ô¨Ånd any overlooked or underestimated physical effects that could reduce the currently estimated global warmings due to a doubling of atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> to negligible proportions or reverse them altogether.&quot; They warn that, thanks to the ocean, &quot;the great and ponderous Ô¨Çywheel of the global climate system,&quot; it is quite possible that the warming would occur sufÔ¨Åciently sluggishly that it would be difÔ¨Åcult to detect in the coming decades. Nevertheless &quot;warming will eventually occur, and the associated regional climatic changes ... may well be signiÔ¨Åcant.&quot; The foreword by the chairman of the Climate Research Board, Verner E. Suomi, summarizes the conclusions with a famous cascade of double negatives. &quot;If carbon dioxide continues to increase, the study group Ô¨Ånds no reason to doubt that climate changes will result and no reason to believe that these changes will be negligible.&quot;<a class="jsx-1614200154 footnote-backref" href="/sewtha#fnref-ch01n14">‚Ü©</a></li><li id="fn-ch01n15"><em>The litany of probable drastic effects of climate change ‚Äì I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôve heard it before</em>.

These differ by only 6% for motor fuels, so it‚Äôs not crucial to distinguish them here, but let me explain anyway. The gross calorific value is the actual chemical energy released when the fuel is burned. One of the products of combustion is water, and in most engines and power stations, part of the energy goes into vaporizing this water. The net calorific value measures how much energy is left over assuming this energy of vaporization is discarded and wasted. When we ask &quot;how much energy does my lifestyle consume?&quot; the gross calorific value is the right quantity to use. The net calorific value, on the other hand, is of interest to a power station engineer, who needs to decide which fuel to burn in his power station. Throughout this book I‚Äôve tried to use gross calorific values.

This is a quote from Hopfield and Gollub (1978), who were writing about panels without concentrating mirrors or lenses. The theoretical limit for a standard &quot;single-junction&quot; solar panel without concentrators, the Shockley‚ÄìQueisser limit, says that at most 31% of the energy in sunlight can be converted to electricity (Shockley and Queisser, 1961). (The main reason for this limit is that a standard solar material has a property called its band-gap, which defines a particular energy of photon that that material converts most efficiently. Sunlight contains photons with many energies; photons with energy <em>below</em> the band-gap are not used at all; photons with energy <em>greater</em> than the band-gap may be captured, but all their energy in excess of the band-gap is lost.) Concentrators (lenses or mirrors) can both reduce the cost (per watt) of photovoltaic systems, and increase their efficiency. The Shockley‚ÄìQueisser limit for solar panels with concentrators is 41% efficiency. The only way to beat the Shockley‚ÄìQueisser limit is to make fancy photovoltaic devices that split the light into different wavelengths, processing each wavelength-range with its own personalized band-gap. These are called multiple-junction photovoltaics. Recently multiple-junction photovoltaics with optical concentrators have been reported to be about 40% efficient. <!-- -->[<a class="jsx-1614200154 " href="http://tinyurl.com/2tl7t6"><span class="websitetitle">2tl7t6</span></a>]<!-- -->, <a class="jsx-1614200154 " href="http://www.spectrolab.com/"><span class="websitetitle">www.spectrolab.com</span></a>.

Economic facts vary, however, and in April 2007 the estimated cost of offshore was up to ¬£92 per MWh (Dept. of Trade and Industry, 2007, p7). By April 2008, the price of offshore wind evidently went even higher: Shell pulled out of their commitment to build the London Array. It‚Äôs because offshore wind is so expensive that the Government is having to increase the number of ROCs (renewable obligation certificates) per unit of offshore wind energy. The ROC is the unit of subsidy given out to certain forms of renewable electricity generation. The standard value of a ROC is ¬£45, with 1 ROC per MWh; so with a wholesale price of roughly ¬£40/MWh, renewable generators are getting paid ¬£85 per MWh. So 1 ROC per MWh is not enough subsidy to cover the cost of ¬£92 per MWh. In the same document, estimates for other renewables (medium levelized costs in 2010) are as follows. Onshore wind: ¬£65‚Äì89/MWh; co-firing of biomass: ¬£53/MWh; large-scale hydro: ¬£63/MWh; sewage gas: ¬£38/MWh; solar PV: ¬£571/MWh; wave: ¬£196/MWh; tide: ¬£177/MWh. &quot;Dale Vince, chief executive of green energy provider Ecotricity, which is engaged in building onshore wind farms, said that he supported the Government‚Äôs <!-- -->[<!-- -->offshore wind<!-- -->]<!-- --> plans, but only if they are not to the detriment of onshore wind. ‚ÄòIt‚Äôs dangerous to overlook the fantastic resource we have in this country. . .

I learnt a brilliant way to automate congestion-charging from Stephen Salter. A simple daily congestion charge, as levied in London, sends only a crude signal to drivers; once a car-owner has decided to pay the day‚Äôs charge and drive into a congestion zone, he has no incentive to drive <em>little</em> in the zone. Nor is he rewarded with any rebate if he carefully chooses routes in the zone that are not congested. Instead of having a centralized authority that decides in advance when and where the congestion-charge zones are, with expensive and intrusive monitoring and recording of vehicle movements into and within all those zones, Salter has a simpler, decentralized, anonymous method of charging drivers for driving in heavy, slow traffic, wherever and whenever it actually exists. The system would operate nationwide. Here‚Äôs how it works. We want a device that answers the question &quot;how congested is the traffic I am driving in?&quot; A good measure of congestion is &quot;how many other active vehicles are close to mine?&quot; In fast-moving traffic, the spacing between vehicles is larger than slow-moving traffic. Traffic that‚Äôs trundling in tedious queues is the most densely packed. The number of nearby vehicles that are active can be sensed anonymously by fitting in every vehicle a radio transmitter/receiver (like a very cheap mobile phone) that transmits little radio-bleeps at a steady rate whenever the engine is running, and that counts the number of bleeps it hears from other vehicles. The congestion charge would be proportional to the number of bleeps received; this charge could be paid at refuelling stations whenever the vehicle is refuelled. The radio transmitter/receiver would replace the current UK road tax disc.<a class="jsx-1614200154 footnote-backref" href="/sewtha#fnref-ch20n09">‚Ü©</a></li><li id="fn-ch20n10"><em>hydraulics and flywheels salvage at least 70% of the braking energy</em>.

But this is the Limits to Growth fallacy, ... which takes no account of the very limited nature of the knowledge we have at any time of what is actually in the Earth‚Äôs crust. Our knowledge of geology is such that we can be confident that identified resources of metal minerals are a small fraction of what is there. &quot;Measured resources of uranium, the amount known to be economically recoverable from orebodies, are ... dependent on the intensity of past exploration effort, and are basically a statement about what is known rather than what is there in the Earth‚Äôs crust. &quot;The world‚Äôs present measured resources of uranium (5.5 Mt) ... are enough to last for over 80 years. This represents a higher level of assured resources than is normal for most minerals. Further exploration and higher prices will certainly, on the basis of present geological knowledge, yield further resources as present ones are used up.&quot; &quot;Economically rational players will only invest in finding these new reserves when they are most confident of gaining a return from them, which usually requires positive price messages caused by undersupply trends. If the economic system is working correctly and maximizing capital efficiency, there should never be more than a few decades of any resource commodity in reserves at any point in time.&quot; <!-- -->[<!-- -->Exploration has a cost; exploring for uranium, for example, has had a cost of $1‚Äì$1.50 per kg of uranium ($3.4/MJ), which is 2% of the spot price of $78/kgU; in contrast, the finding costs of crude oil have averaged around $6/barrel ($1050/MJ) (12% of the spot price) over at least the past three decades.<!-- -->]<!-- --> &quot;Unlike the metals which have been in demand for centuries, society has barely begun to utilize uranium.

One death per 200 GWy is an impressively low death rate compared with the fossil fuel industry. Worldwide, the nuclear-power historical death rate is hard to estimate. The Three Mile Island meltdown killed no-one, and the associated leaks are estimated to have perhaps killed one person in the time since the accident. The accident at Chernobyl first killed 62 who died directly from exposure, and 15 local people who died later of thyroid cancer; it‚Äôs estimated that nearby, another 4000 died of cancer, and that worldwide, about 5000 people (among 7¬†million who were exposed to fallout) died of cancer because of Chernobyl (Williams and Baverstock, 2006); but these deaths are impossible to detect because cancers, many of them caused by natural nuclear radiation, already cause 25% of deaths in Europe. One way to estimate a global death rate from nuclear power worldwide is to divide this estimate of Chernobyl‚Äôs deathtoll (9000 deaths) by the cumulative output of nuclear power from 1969 to 1996, which was 3685 GWy.

They could be packed at a concentration of one dish per 500¬†m<sup>2</sup>. That‚Äôs an average power of <span class="green">14 W/m<sup>2</sup></span>. They say that solar dish Stirling makes the best use of land area, in terms of energy delivered. <a class="jsx-1614200154 " href="http://www.ausra.com/"><span class="websitetitle">www.ausra.com</span></a> uses flat mirrors to heat water to 285 ¬∞C and drive a steam turbine. The heated, pressurized water can be stored in deep metal-lined caverns to allow power generation at night. Describing a &quot;240 MW(e)&quot; plant proposed for Australia (Mills and Li√àvre, 2004), the designers claim that 3.5 km<sup>2</sup> of mirrors would deliver 1.2 TWh(e); that‚Äôs 38 W/m<sup>2</sup> of mirror. To find the power per unit land area, we need to allow for the gaps between the mirrors. Ausra say they need a 153 km by 153 km square in the desert to supply all US electric power (Mills and Morgan, 2008). Total US electricity is 3600 TWh/y, so they are claiming a power per unit land area of <span class="green">18 W/m<sup>2</sup></span>. This technology goes by the name <em>compact linear fresnel reflector</em> (Mills and Morrison, 2000; Mills et al., 2004; Mills and Morgan, 2008). Incidentally, rather than &quot;concentrating solar power,&quot; the company Ausra prefers to use the term <em>solar thermal electricity</em> (STE); they emphasize the benefits of thermal storage, in contrast to concentrating photovoltaics, which don‚Äôt come with a natural storage option. Trieb and Knies (2004), who are strong proponents of concentrating solar power, project that the alternative concentrating solar power technologies would have powers per unit land area in the following ranges: parabolic troughs, <span class="green">14‚Äì19 W/m<sup>2</sup></span>; linear fresnel collector, <span class="green">19‚Äì28 W/m<sup>2</sup></span>; tower with heliostats, <span class="green">9‚Äì14 W/m<sup>2</sup></span>; stirling dish, <span class="green">9‚Äì14 W/m<sup>2</sup></span>. There are three European demonstration plants for concentrating solar power. Andasol ‚Äì using parabolic troughs; Sol√∫car PS10, a tower near Seville; and Solartres, a tower using molten salt for heat storage. The Andasol parabolictrough system shown in figure 25.4 is predicted to deliver 10 W/m<sup>2</sup>. Sol√∫car‚Äôs &quot;11 MW&quot; solar tower has 624¬†mirrors, each 121¬†m<sup>2</sup>. The mirrors concentrate sunlight to a radiation density of up to 650¬†kW/m<sup>2</sup>. The receiver receives a peak power of 55 MW. The power station can store 20 MWh of thermal energy, allowing it to keep going during 50¬†minutes of cloudiness.

Well, if the earth were a perfect sphere, a smooth billiard ball covered by oceans, the tidal effect of the earth-moon whirling would be to deform the water slightly towards and away from the moon, making the water slightly rugby-ball shaped (figure 14.1). Someone living on the equator of this billiard-ball earth, spinning round once per day within the water cocoon, would notice the water level going up and down twice per day: up once as he passed under the nose of the rugby-ball, and up a second time as he passed under its tail. This cartoon explanation is some way from reality. In reality, the earth is not smooth, and it is not uniformly covered by water (as you may have noticed). Two humps of water cannot whoosh round the earth once per day because the continents get in the way. The true behaviour of the tides is thus more complicated. In a large body of water such as the Atlantic Ocean, tidal crests and troughs form but, unable to whoosh round the earth, they do the next best thing: they whoosh around the perimeter of the Ocean. In the North Atlantic there are two crests and two troughs, all circling the Atlantic in an anticlockwise direction once a day. Here in Britain we don\\u2019t directly see these Atlantic crests and troughs \\u2013 we are set back from the Atlantic proper, separated from it by a few hundred miles of paddling pool called the continental shelf. Each time one of the crests whooshes by in the Atlantic proper, it sends a crest up our paddling pool. Similarly each Atlantic trough sends a trough up the paddling pool. Consecutive crests and troughs are separated by six hours. Or to be more precise, by six and a quarter hours, since the time between moon-rises is about 25, not 24 hours.\"),mdx(\"p\",null,mdx(\"img\",e({parentName:\"p\"},{src:\"/img/sewtha/figure97.gif\",alt:null}))),mdx(\"span\",{class:\"figurenumber\"},\"Figure 14.2\"),\".

The shallower the paddling pool gets, the slower the crests and troughs travel and the larger they get. Out in the ocean, the tides are just a foot or two in height. Arriving in European estuaries, the tidal range is often as big as four metres. In the northern hemisphere, the Coriolis force (a force, associated with the rotation of the earth, that acts only on moving objects) makes all tidal crests and troughs tend to hug the right-hand bank as they go. For example, the tides in the English channel are bigger on the French side.

But here are seven reasons for being excited about tidal power in the British Isles. 1. Tidal power is completely predictable; unlike wind and sun, tidal power is a renewable on which one could depend; it works day and night all year round; using tidal lagoons, energy can be stored so that power can be delivered on demand. 2. Successive high and low tides take about 12 hours to progress around the British Isles, so the strongest currents off Anglesey, Islay, Orkney and Dover occur at different times from each other; thus, together, a collection of tide farms could produce a more constant contribution to the electrical grid than one tide farm, albeit a contribution that wanders up and down with the phase of the moon. 3. Tidal power will last for millions of years. 4. It doesn\\u2019t require high-cost hardware, in contrast to solar photovoltaic power. 5. Moreover, because the power density of a typical tidal flow is greater than the power density of a typical wind, a 1 MW tide turbine is smaller in size than a 1 MW wind turbine; perhaps tide turbines could therefore be cheaper than wind turbines. 6. Life below the waves is peaceful; there is no such thing as a freak tidal storm; so, unlike wind turbines, which require costly engineering to withstand rare windstorms, underwater tide turbines will not require big safety factors in their design. 7. Humans mostly live on the land, and they can\\u2019t see under the sea, so objections to the visual impact of tide turbines should be less strong than the objections to wind turbines.\"),mdx(\"h3\",e({},{id:\"mythconceptions-4\"}),\"Mythconceptions\"),mdx(\"h4\",e({},{id:\"tidal-power-while-clean-and-green-should-not-be-called-renewable-extracting-power-from-the-tides-slows-down-the-earths-rotation-we-definitely-cant-use-tidal-power-long-term\"}),\"Tidal power, while clean and green, should not be called renewable.

But coal station owners will invest in carbon capture and storage only if they are convinced that the price of carbon is going to be high enough for long enough that carbon-capturing facilities will pay for themselves.

Alternatively they could issue carbon pollution permits in an auction with a fixed minimum price.

The appropriate rocks to break down include olivines or magnesium silicate minerals, which are widespread. The idea would be to find mines in places surrounded by many square kilometres of land on which crushed rocks could be spread, or perhaps to spread the crushed rocks directly on the oceans. Either way, the rocks would absorb CO\",mdx(\"sub\",null,\"2\"),\" and turn into carbonates and the resulting carbonates would end up being washed into the oceans.

My tacit assumption that the engine\\u2019s efficiency is the same at all speeds and all loads led to the conclusion that it\\u2019s always good (in terms of miles per gallon) to travel slower; but if the engine\\u2019s efficiency drops off at low speeds, then the most fuel-efficient speed might be at an intermediate speed that makes a compromise between going slow and keeping the engine efficient. For the BMW 318ti in figure A.12, for example, the optimum speed is about 60 km/h. But if society were to decide that car speeds should be reduced, there is nothing to stop engines and gears being redesigned so that the peak engine efficiency was found at the right speed. As further evidence that the power a car requires really does increase as the cube of speed, figure A.13 shows the engine power versus the top speeds of a range of cars.

The upper curve shows the result for a battery whose energy density is 40 Wh/kg (old-style lead-acid batteries). The range is limited by a wall at about 500 km. To get close to this maximum range, we have to take along comically large batteries: for a range of 400 km, for example, 2000 kg of batteries are required, and the transport cost is above 25\\xA0kWh per 100 km. If we are content with a range of 180 km, however, we can get by with 500 kg of batteries. Things get much better when we switch to lighter lithium-ion batteries.

If these batteries were divided into ten 25 kg chunks, separately unpluggable, then a car user could keep just four of the ten chunks on board when he\\u2019s doing regular commuting (100 kg gives a range of 140 km); and collect an extra six chunks from a battery-recharging station when he wants to make longer-range trips.

The over-emotional debate about this topic is getting quite tiresome, isn\\u2019t it? \"The science is now settled.\" \"No it isn\\u2019t',\"!\",'\" \"Yes it is',\"!\",'\" I think the most helpful thing I can do here is direct anyone who wants a break from the shouting to a brief report written by Charney et al. (1979). This report\\u2019s conclusions carry weight because the National Academy of Sciences (the US equivalent of the Royal Society) commissioned the report and selected its authors on the basis of their expertise, \"and with regard for appropriate balance.\" The study group was convened \"under the auspices of the Climate Research Board of the National Research Council to assess the scienti\\uFB01c basis for projection of possible future climatic changes resulting from man-made releases of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.\" Speci\\uFB01cally, they were asked: \"to identify the principal premises on which our current understanding of the question is based, to assess quantitatively the adequacy and uncertainty of our knowledge of these factors and processes, and to summarize in concise and objective terms our best present understanding of the carbon dioxide/climate issue for the bene\\uFB01t of policy-makers.\" The report is just 33 pages long, it is free to download ',\"[\",mdx(\"a\",e({parentName:\"li\"},{href:\"http://tinyurl.com/5qfkaw\"}),mdx(\"span\",{class:\"websitetitle\"},\"5qfkaw\")),\"]\",\", and I recommend it. It makes clear which bits of the science were already settled in 1979, and which bits still had uncertainty. Here are the main points I picked up from this report. First, doubling the atmospheric CO\",mdx(\"sub\",null,\"2\"),\" concentration would change the net heating of the troposphere, oceans, and land by an average power per unit area of roughly 4 W/m\",mdx(\"sup\",null,\"2\"),\", if all other properties of the atmosphere remained unchanged. This heating effect can be compared with the average power absorbed by the atmosphere, land, and oceans, which is 238 W/m\",mdx(\"sup\",null,\"2\"),\". So doubling CO\",mdx(\"sub\",null,\"2\"),\" concentrations would have a warming effect equivalent to increasing the intensity of the sun by 4/238 = 1.7%. Second, the consequences of this CO\",mdx(\"sub\",null,\"2\"),'-induced heating are hard to predict, on account of the complexity of the atmosphere/ocean system, but the authors predicted a global surface warming of between 2\\xB0C and 3.5\\xB0C, with greater increases at high latitudes. Finally, the authors summarize: \"we have tried but have been unable to \\uFB01nd any overlooked or underestimated physical effects that could reduce the currently estimated global warmings due to a doubling of atmospheric CO',mdx(\"sub\",null,\"2\"),' to negligible proportions or reverse them altogether.\" They warn that, thanks to the ocean, \"the great and ponderous \\uFB02ywheel of the global climate system,\" it is quite possible that the warming would occur suf\\uFB01ciently sluggishly that it would be dif\\uFB01cult to detect in the coming decades. Nevertheless \"warming will eventually occur, and the associated regional climatic changes ... may well be signi\\uFB01cant.\" The foreword by the chairman of the Climate Research Board, Verner E. Suomi, summarizes the conclusions with a famous cascade of double negatives. \"If carbon dioxide continues to increase, the study group \\uFB01nds no reason to doubt that climate changes will result and no reason to believe that these changes will be negligible.\"',mdx(\"a\",e({parentName:\"li\"},{href:\"#fnref-ch01n14\",className:\"footnote-backref\"}),\"\\u21A9\")),mdx(\"li\",e({parentName:\"ol\"},{id:\"fn-ch01n15\"}),mdx(\"em\",{parentName:\"li\"},\"The litany of probable drastic effects of climate change \\u2013 I\\u2019m sure you\\u2019ve heard it before\"),\".

The gross calorific value is the actual chemical energy released when the fuel is burned. One of the products of combustion is water, and in most engines and power stations, part of the energy goes into vaporizing this water. The net calorific value measures how much energy is left over assuming this energy of vaporization is discarded and wasted. When we ask \"how much energy does my lifestyle consume?\" the gross calorific value is the right quantity to use. The net calorific value, on the other hand, is of interest to a power station engineer, who needs to decide which fuel to burn in his power station. Throughout this book I\\u2019ve tried to use gross calorific values.

The theoretical limit for a standard \"single-junction\" solar panel without concentrators, the Shockley\\u2013Queisser limit, says that at most 31% of the energy in sunlight can be converted to electricity (Shockley and Queisser, 1961). (The main reason for this limit is that a standard solar material has a property called its band-gap, which defines a particular energy of photon that that material converts most efficiently.

The Shockley\\u2013Queisser limit for solar panels with concentrators is 41% efficiency. The only way to beat the Shockley\\u2013Queisser limit is to make fancy photovoltaic devices that split the light into different wavelengths, processing each wavelength-range with its own personalized band-gap.

I learnt a brilliant way to automate congestion-charging from Stephen Salter. A simple daily congestion charge, as levied in London, sends only a crude signal to drivers; once a car-owner has decided to pay the day\\u2019s charge and drive into a congestion zone, he has no incentive to drive \",mdx(\"em\",{parentName:\"li\"},\"little\"),' in the zone. Nor is he rewarded with any rebate if he carefully chooses routes in the zone that are not congested. Instead of having a centralized authority that decides in advance when and where the congestion-charge zones are, with expensive and intrusive monitoring and recording of vehicle movements into and within all those zones, Salter has a simpler, decentralized, anonymous method of charging drivers for driving in heavy, slow traffic, wherever and whenever it actually exists. The system would operate nationwide. Here\\u2019s how it works. We want a device that answers the question \"how congested is the traffic I am driving in?\" A good measure of congestion is \"how many other active vehicles are close to mine?\" In fast-moving traffic, the spacing between vehicles is larger than slow-moving traffic. Traffic that\\u2019s trundling in tedious queues is the most densely packed. The number of nearby vehicles that are active can be sensed anonymously by fitting in every vehicle a radio transmitter/receiver (like a very cheap mobile phone) that transmits little radio-bleeps at a steady rate whenever the engine is running, and that counts the number of bleeps it hears from other vehicles. The congestion charge would be proportional to the number of bleeps received; this charge could be paid at refuelling stations whenever the vehicle is refuelled. The radio transmitter/receiver would replace the current UK road tax disc.',mdx(\"a\",e({parentName:\"li\"},{href:\"#fnref-ch20n09\",className:\"footnote-backref\"}),\"\\u21A9\")),mdx(\"li\",e({parentName:\"ol\"},{id:\"fn-ch20n10\"}),mdx(\"em\",{parentName:\"li\"},\"hydraulics and flywheels salvage at least 70% of the braking energy\"),'.

The Three Mile Island meltdown killed no-one, and the associated leaks are estimated to have perhaps killed one person in the time since the accident. The accident at Chernobyl first killed 62 who died directly from exposure, and 15 local people who died later of thyroid cancer; it\\u2019s estimated that nearby, another 4000 died of cancer, and that worldwide, about 5000 people (among 7\\xA0million who were exposed to fallout) died of cancer because of Chernobyl (Williams and Baverstock, 2006); but these deaths are impossible to detect because cancers, many of them caused by natural nuclear radiation, already cause 25% of deaths in Europe. One way to estimate a global death rate from nuclear power worldwide is to divide this estimate of Chernobyl\\u2019s deathtoll (9000 deaths) by the cumulative output of nuclear power from 1969 to 1996, which was 3685 GWy. This gives a death rate of 2.4 deaths per GWy.

In the mid-1990s the mortality rate associated with wind power was 3.5 deaths per GWy. According to Paul Gipe, the worldwide mortality rate of wind power dropped to 1.3 deaths per GWy by the end of 2000.
