Well, if the earth were a perfect sphere, a smooth billiard ball covered by oceans, the tidal effect of the earth-moon whirling would be to deform the water slightly towards and away from the moon, making the water slightly rugby-ball shaped (figure 14.1). Someone living on the equator of this billiard-ball earth, spinning round once per day within the water cocoon, would notice the water level going up and down twice per day: up once as he passed under the nose of the rugby-ball, and up a second time as he passed under its tail. This cartoon explanation is some way from reality. In reality, the earth is not smooth, and it is not uniformly covered by water (as you may have noticed). Two humps of water cannot whoosh round the earth once per day because the continents get in the way. The true behaviour of the tides is thus more complicated. In a large body of water such as the Atlantic Ocean, tidal crests and troughs form but, unable to whoosh round the earth, they do the next best thing: they whoosh around the perimeter of the Ocean. In the North Atlantic there are two crests and two troughs, all circling the Atlantic in an anticlockwise direction once a day. Here in Britain we don\\u2019t directly see these Atlantic crests and troughs \\u2013 we are set back from the Atlantic proper, separated from it by a few hundred miles of paddling pool called the continental shelf. Each time one of the crests whooshes by in the Atlantic proper, it sends a crest up our paddling pool. Similarly each Atlantic trough sends a trough up the paddling pool. Consecutive crests and troughs are separated by six hours. Or to be more precise, by six and a quarter hours, since the time between moon-rises is about 25, not 24 hours.\"),mdx(\"p\",null,mdx(\"img\",e({parentName:\"p\"},{src:\"/img/sewtha/figure97.gif\",alt:null}))),mdx(\"span\",{class:\"figurenumber\"},\"Figure 14.2\"),\".

In the northern hemisphere, the Coriolis force (a force, associated with the rotation of the earth, that acts only on moving objects) makes all tidal crests and troughs tend to hug the right-hand bank as they go.

Tidal power is completely predictable; unlike wind and sun, tidal power is a renewable on which one could depend; it works day and night all year round; using tidal lagoons, energy can be stored so that power can be delivered on demand. 2. Successive high and low tides take about 12 hours to progress around the British Isles, so the strongest currents off Anglesey, Islay, Orkney and Dover occur at different times from each other; thus, together, a collection of tide farms could produce a more constant contribution to the electrical grid than one tide farm, albeit a contribution that wanders up and down with the phase of the moon. 3. Tidal power will last for millions of years. 4. It doesn\\u2019t require high-cost hardware, in contrast to solar photovoltaic power. 5. Moreover, because the power density of a typical tidal flow is greater than the power density of a typical wind, a 1 MW tide turbine is smaller in size than a 1 MW wind turbine; perhaps tide turbines could therefore be cheaper than wind turbines. 6. Life below the waves is peaceful; there is no such thing as a freak tidal storm; so, unlike wind turbines, which require costly engineering to withstand rare windstorms, underwater tide turbines will not require big safety factors in their design. 7.

The cryogenic tank of the BMW Hydrogen 7 weighs 120 kg and stores 8 kg of hydrogen. Furthermore, hydrogen gradually leaks out of any practical container.

So our power engineers already cope, every day, with slew rates bigger than 4GW per hour on the national grid. An extra occasional slew of 4 GW per hour induced by sudden wind variations is no reasonable cause for ditching the idea of country-sized wind farms. It\\u2019s a problem just like problems that engineers have already solved. We simply need to figure out how to match ever-changing supply and demand in a grid with no fossil fuels.

So they are dwarfed by current human carbon emissions, which are about 40 times bigger.

The appropriate rocks to break down include olivines or magnesium silicate minerals, which are widespread. The idea would be to find mines in places surrounded by many square kilometres of land on which crushed rocks could be spread, or perhaps to spread the crushed rocks directly on the oceans. Either way, the rocks would absorb CO\",mdx(\"sub\",null,\"2\"),\" and turn into carbonates and the resulting carbonates would end up being washed into the oceans.

If my suggested experiment of halving the car\\u2019s speed takes the car out of this designed range of speeds, the consumption might not fall by as much as four-fold. My tacit assumption that the engine\\u2019s efficiency is the same at all speeds and all loads led to the conclusion that it\\u2019s always good (in terms of miles per gallon) to travel slower; but if the engine\\u2019s efficiency drops off at low speeds, then the most fuel-efficient speed might be at an intermediate speed that makes a compromise between going slow and keeping the engine efficient. For the BMW 318ti in figure A.12, for example, the optimum speed is about 60 km/h. But if society were to decide that car speeds should be reduced, there is nothing to stop engines and gears being redesigned so that the peak engine efficiency was found at the right speed.

The upper curve shows the result for a battery whose energy density is 40 Wh/kg (old-style lead-acid batteries). The range is limited by a wall at about 500 km.

So whereas lowering speed-limits for cars would reduce the energy consumed per distance travelled, there is no point in considering speed-limits for planes.

The over-emotional debate about this topic is getting quite tiresome, isn\\u2019t it? \"The science is now settled.\" \"No it isn\\u2019t',\"!\",'\" \"Yes it is',\"!\",'\" I think the most helpful thing I can do here is direct anyone who wants a break from the shouting to a brief report written by Charney et al. (1979). This report\\u2019s conclusions carry weight because the National Academy of Sciences (the US equivalent of the Royal Society) commissioned the report and selected its authors on the basis of their expertise, \"and with regard for appropriate balance.\" The study group was convened \"under the auspices of the Climate Research Board of the National Research Council to assess the scienti\\uFB01c basis for projection of possible future climatic changes resulting from man-made releases of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.\" Speci\\uFB01cally, they were asked: \"to identify the principal premises on which our current understanding of the question is based, to assess quantitatively the adequacy and uncertainty of our knowledge of these factors and processes, and to summarize in concise and objective terms our best present understanding of the carbon dioxide/climate issue for the bene\\uFB01t of policy-makers.\" The report is just 33 pages long, it is free to download ',\"[\",mdx(\"a\",e({parentName:\"li\"},{href:\"http://tinyurl.com/5qfkaw\"}),mdx(\"span\",{class:\"websitetitle\"},\"5qfkaw\")),\"]\",\", and I recommend it. It makes clear which bits of the science were already settled in 1979, and which bits still had uncertainty. Here are the main points I picked up from this report. First, doubling the atmospheric CO\",mdx(\"sub\",null,\"2\"),\" concentration would change the net heating of the troposphere, oceans, and land by an average power per unit area of roughly 4 W/m\",mdx(\"sup\",null,\"2\"),\", if all other properties of the atmosphere remained unchanged. This heating effect can be compared with the average power absorbed by the atmosphere, land, and oceans, which is 238 W/m\",mdx(\"sup\",null,\"2\"),\". So doubling CO\",mdx(\"sub\",null,\"2\"),\" concentrations would have a warming effect equivalent to increasing the intensity of the sun by 4/238 = 1.7%. Second, the consequences of this CO\",mdx(\"sub\",null,\"2\"),'-induced heating are hard to predict, on account of the complexity of the atmosphere/ocean system, but the authors predicted a global surface warming of between 2\\xB0C and 3.5\\xB0C, with greater increases at high latitudes. Finally, the authors summarize: \"we have tried but have been unable to \\uFB01nd any overlooked or underestimated physical effects that could reduce the currently estimated global warmings due to a doubling of atmospheric CO',mdx(\"sub\",null,\"2\"),' to negligible proportions or reverse them altogether.\" They warn that, thanks to the ocean, \"the great and ponderous \\uFB02ywheel of the global climate system,\" it is quite possible that the warming would occur suf\\uFB01ciently sluggishly that it would be dif\\uFB01cult to detect in the coming decades. Nevertheless \"warming will eventually occur, and the associated regional climatic changes ... may well be signi\\uFB01cant.\" The foreword by the chairman of the Climate Research Board, Verner E. Suomi, summarizes the conclusions with a famous cascade of double negatives. \"If carbon dioxide continues to increase, the study group \\uFB01nds no reason to doubt that climate changes will result and no reason to believe that these changes will be negligible.\"',mdx(\"a\",e({parentName:\"li\"},{href:\"#fnref-ch01n14\",className:\"footnote-backref\"}),\"\\u21A9\")),mdx(\"li\",e({parentName:\"ol\"},{id:\"fn-ch01n15\"}),mdx(\"em\",{parentName:\"li\"},\"The litany of probable drastic effects of climate change \\u2013 I\\u2019m sure you\\u2019ve heard it before\"),\".

The gross calorific value is the actual chemical energy released when the fuel is burned. One of the products of combustion is water, and in most engines and power stations, part of the energy goes into vaporizing this water. The net calorific value measures how much energy is left over assuming this energy of vaporization is discarded and wasted. When we ask \"how much energy does my lifestyle consume?\" the gross calorific value is the right quantity to use. The net calorific value, on the other hand, is of interest to a power station engineer, who needs to decide which fuel to burn in his power station. Throughout this book I\\u2019ve tried to use gross calorific values.

The theoretical limit for a standard \"single-junction\" solar panel without concentrators, the Shockley\\u2013Queisser limit, says that at most 31% of the energy in sunlight can be converted to electricity (Shockley and Queisser, 1961). (The main reason for this limit is that a standard solar material has a property called its band-gap, which defines a particular energy of photon that that material converts most efficiently.

The Shockley\\u2013Queisser limit for solar panels with concentrators is 41% efficiency. The only way to beat the Shockley\\u2013Queisser limit is to make fancy photovoltaic devices that split the light into different wavelengths, processing each wavelength-range with its own personalized band-gap.

I learnt a brilliant way to automate congestion-charging from Stephen Salter. A simple daily congestion charge, as levied in London, sends only a crude signal to drivers; once a car-owner has decided to pay the day\\u2019s charge and drive into a congestion zone, he has no incentive to drive \",mdx(\"em\",{parentName:\"li\"},\"little\"),' in the zone. Nor is he rewarded with any rebate if he carefully chooses routes in the zone that are not congested. Instead of having a centralized authority that decides in advance when and where the congestion-charge zones are, with expensive and intrusive monitoring and recording of vehicle movements into and within all those zones, Salter has a simpler, decentralized, anonymous method of charging drivers for driving in heavy, slow traffic, wherever and whenever it actually exists. The system would operate nationwide. Here\\u2019s how it works. We want a device that answers the question \"how congested is the traffic I am driving in?\" A good measure of congestion is \"how many other active vehicles are close to mine?\" In fast-moving traffic, the spacing between vehicles is larger than slow-moving traffic. Traffic that\\u2019s trundling in tedious queues is the most densely packed. The number of nearby vehicles that are active can be sensed anonymously by fitting in every vehicle a radio transmitter/receiver (like a very cheap mobile phone) that transmits little radio-bleeps at a steady rate whenever the engine is running, and that counts the number of bleeps it hears from other vehicles. The congestion charge would be proportional to the number of bleeps received; this charge could be paid at refuelling stations whenever the vehicle is refuelled. The radio transmitter/receiver would replace the current UK road tax disc.',mdx(\"a\",e({parentName:\"li\"},{href:\"#fnref-ch20n09\",className:\"footnote-backref\"}),\"\\u21A9\")),mdx(\"li\",e({parentName:\"ol\"},{id:\"fn-ch20n10\"}),mdx(\"em\",{parentName:\"li\"},\"hydraulics and flywheels salvage at least 70% of the braking energy\"),'.

The Three Mile Island meltdown killed no-one, and the associated leaks are estimated to have perhaps killed one person in the time since the accident. The accident at Chernobyl first killed 62 who died directly from exposure, and 15 local people who died later of thyroid cancer; it\\u2019s estimated that nearby, another 4000 died of cancer, and that worldwide, about 5000 people (among 7\\xA0million who were exposed to fallout) died of cancer because of Chernobyl (Williams and Baverstock, 2006); but these deaths are impossible to detect because cancers, many of them caused by natural nuclear radiation, already cause 25% of deaths in Europe. One way to estimate a global death rate from nuclear power worldwide is to divide this estimate of Chernobyl\\u2019s deathtoll (9000 deaths) by the cumulative output of nuclear power from 1969 to 1996, which was 3685 GWy. This gives a death rate of 2.4 deaths per GWy.

In the mid-1990s the mortality rate associated with wind power was 3.5 deaths per GWy. According to Paul Gipe, the worldwide mortality rate of wind power dropped to 1.3 deaths per GWy by the end of 2000.
