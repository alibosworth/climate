This repository is for my own research and investigations on climate change.

My purpose is not to create anything especially original. Rather the intention
is to report what a non-expert but intelligent person like myself can discover.
(A hopeful title might be an "intelligent person's incomplete guide to climate
change.")

Motivating questions:

* What is actually happening? For example:
  * How much CO2 (and GHGs) are we emitting? How much is that relative to the past?
  * What impact has there been on the temperature and the climate? What is likely future impact?
  * What impact has there been on the planet and on humans -- already and in the future?
* What's causing this? For example, what is the role of different countries and different energy sources in generating CO2 and GHGs?
  * Also what actors -- countries, corporations etc -- are behind this, and who is blocking change?
* What can we do about all of this?
  * What is the case for action?
  * What policies can we use to reduce emissions?
  * What cleantech do we need, what investment do we need?
  * What kind of mitigation or adaptation is possible?
  * Is it "too late" to stop dangerous warming?
  

## Conceptual Model

I am using the following very rough conceptual model for thinking climate change and policy.


```
1. Human Processes (e.g. energy production, travel etc)
      |
      |           <--- Policy (emissions controls, cleantech)
      |
      V
2. Green House Gases (GHG)
      |
      |           <--- Sequestration
      |
      V
3. Climate Change (temperature, sea level, weather patterns)
      |
      |
      |
      V
4. Direct Impact (storms, ecosystem changes etc)
      |
      |            <----- Policy (mitigation, adaptation, transfers)
      |
      V
5. Indirect Impact (homes lost, hurricance damage)
      |
      |            <----- Policy (rebuilding, compensation)
      |
      V
6. Impact on Lives  (measured in well-being $)
```

Reading IPCC reports efforts -- and greatest certainty -- have been 2+3: GHG and immediate climate change.

My intention, for the present, is to focus on these: to gather the best summary data on these two areas and set it out in a simple and compelling way.

Later one could expand in two directions. First, backwards into the causes of GHG. In particular, what is the composition of energy production and use and how could that change. 

Second, forwards into the impact. The impacts is ultimately what matters but also the area where there is the greatest uncertainty. Right now we could focus on some of the things that have already been happening: the increasing number of forest fires, the growing number of extreme weather incidents etc. Just documenting them and assigning some probability score would be useful.
