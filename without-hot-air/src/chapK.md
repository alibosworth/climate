<span class="figurenumber">Figure K.2.</span> Left: UK net electricity supplied, by source, in kWh per day per person. (Another 0.9 kWh/d/p is generated and used by the generators themselves.) Right: the energy gap created by UK power station closures, as projected by energy company EdF. This graph shows the predicted *capacity* of nuclear, coal, and oil power stations, in kilowatt-hours per day per person. The capacity is the maximum deliverable power of a source.

Figure K.3. Electricity demand in Great Britain (in kWh/d per person) during two winter weeks of 2006. The peaks in January are at 6pm each day. (If you’d like to obtain the national demand in GW, the top of the scale, 24 kWh/d per person, is the same as 60 GW per UK.)

|             | 2006    | 2007    |
| ----------------------------------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| "Primary units" (the first 2 kWh/d) | 10.73 p/kWh | 17.43 p/kWh |
| "Secondary units" (the rest)    | 8.13 p/kWh  | 9.70 p/kWh  |
