Source: MacLeay et al. (2007). In 2006, large-scale hydro produced 3515 GWh (from plant with a capacity of 1.37 GW); small-scale hydro, 212 GWh (0.01 kWh/d/p) (from a capacity of 153 MW). In 1943, when the growth of hydroelectricity was in full swing, the North of Scotland Hydroelectricity Board‚Äôs engineers estimated that the Highlands of Scotland could produce 6.3 TWh per year in 102 facilities ‚Äì that would correspond to 0.3 kWh/d per person in the UK (Ross, 2008). Glendoe, the first new large-scale hydroelectric project in the UK since 1957, will add capacity of 100 MW and is expected to deliver 180 GWh per year. Glendoe‚Äôs catchment area is 75 km<sup>2</sup>, so its power density works out to 0.27 W per m<sup>2</sup> of catchment area. Glendoe has been billed as &quot;big enough to power Glasgow.&quot; But if we share its 180 GWh per year across the population of Glasgow (616 000 people), we get only 0.8 kWh/d per person. That is just 5% of the average electricity consumption of 17 kWh/d per person. The 20fold exaggeration is achieved by focusing on Glendoe‚Äôs peak output rather than its average, which is 5 times smaller; and by discussing &quot;homes&quot; rather than the total electrical power of Glasgow (see p329).<a class="jsx-1614200154 footnote-backref" href="/without-hot-air/chap08/#fnref-3">‚Ü©</a></li></ol></div></section></article></main><footer class="flex items-center justify-center w-full h-24 border-t"><a class="flex items-center justify-center" href="https://vercel.com?utm_source=create-next-app&amp;utm_medium=default-template&amp;utm_campaign=create-next-app" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A Project of<img src="/life-itself-logo.svg" alt="Life Itself Logo" class="h-12 block"/></a></footer></div><script id="__NEXT_DATA__" type="application/json">{"props":{"pageProps":{"source":{"compiledSource":"var c=Object.defineProperty,u=Object.defineProperties;var d=Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptors;var i=Object.getOwnPropertySymbols;var s=Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty,n=Object.prototype.propertyIsEnumerable;var l=(a,t,r)=\u003et in a?c(a,t,{enumerable:!0,configurable:!0,writable:!0,value:r}):a[t]=r,e=(a,t)=\u003e{for(var r in t||(t={}))s.call(t,r)\u0026\u0026l(a,r,t[r]);if(i)for(var r of i(t))n.call(t,r)\u0026\u0026l(a,r,t[r]);return a},h=(a,t)=\u003eu(a,d(t));var p=(a,t)=\u003e{var r={};for(var o in a)s.call(a,o)\u0026\u0026t.indexOf(o)\u003c0\u0026\u0026(r[o]=a[o]);if(a!=null\u0026\u0026i)for(var o of i(a))t.indexOf(o)\u003c0\u0026\u0026n.call(a,o)\u0026\u0026(r[o]=a[o]);return r};const layoutProps={},MDXLayout=\"wrapper\";function MDXContent(r){var o=r,{components:a}=o,t=p(o,[\"components\"]);return mdx(MDXLayout,h(e(e({},layoutProps),t),{components:a,mdxType:\"MDXLayout\"}),mdx(\"h1\",e({},{id:\"8-hydroelectricity\"}),\"8 Hydroelectricity\"),mdx(\"p\",null,mdx(\"img\",e({parentName:\"p\"},{src:\"/img/without-hot-air/figure64.gif\",alt:null}))),mdx(\"span\",{class:\"figurenumber\"},\"Figure 8.1\"),\".
