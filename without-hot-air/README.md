David MacKay's *Sustainable Energy - Without the Hot Air* (http://withouthotair.com).

This includes all source versions plus a markdown conversion.

The aim is to provide a base for:

* Collaborative updating of the text. It was published in 2008. As David tragically passed away in 2016 the book did not get to updated and is now, as of 2020, becoming a little out of date. See this 2017 article on Carbon Commentary with concrete suggestions https://www.carboncommentary.com/blog/2017/3/30/l6qcqgoedse1wmjjz87t09usoq6jva and associated thread on ycombinator: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=14009057
* An updated web publication of the text: similarly to the previous point the existing web version of the text could benefit from a more up to date presentation.

## Credits

First, of course to David MacKay. This book was a landmark and one I personally got a lot from.

Second, a credit to Tito Jankowski who did a first pass in 2017 on getting this into source form https://github.com/titojankowski/sustainable_energy_without_the_hot_air. Whilst we have started again from the raw EPub due to quality issues that repo was an inspiration for this effort.
