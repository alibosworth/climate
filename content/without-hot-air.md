## Why this project

David MacKay tragically passed away in 2016. His wonderful book (and website) were first published in 2008. The material is still of great value. However, is has not been updated since publication and now won't be (at least by David). David made his book available in machine readable formats and licensed the book (semi-)openly meaning it can be modified and redistributed.

The book remains a go-to reference and extremely useful. However it is getting out of date -- e.g. solar situation in 2020 is dramatically different from a decade earlier.[^1] Its current format is not easily editable nor is in a repository where it can be collaboratively worked on. Finally, there is the risk the book and site could one day disappear.

In this project we have:

* Created a source form in markdown which is much easier to edit, reuse and publish
* Put it in a public [git(hub) repo][git] which makes it easy for others to collaborate
* Archived original material so that it is preserved

What this makes possible

* Creating a revised edition collaboratively to bring it up to date
* Easier reuse and referencing by others
* Adding additional functionality (e.g. annotation, search etc)
